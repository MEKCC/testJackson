      "text": "Posted By: Editor\nSo, the news we’ve known about for months has finally been confirmed. The UK is officially in recession for the first time in 11 years. In formal terms, that means the economy has shrunk for two quarters in a row. Between April and June, the economy declined by 20.4% compared to the previous quarter. So it’s a biggie. But on the upside, the bulk of the pain happened in April, and May and June have actually seen an uptick.\n© Provided by The Motley Fool Economic Uncertainty Ahead Sign With Stormy Background\nHas your investing strategy helped you through? Load Error\nIf you invest in shares, you won’t need me to tell you that the UK stock market has crashed this year. And despite the pullback we’ve seen since the early carnage, the tentative recovery has cooled off a bit as people realise how long the economic downturn could continue.\nSo what investing strategy should we go for now? Which shares should we invest in to keep us financially safest until the danger is past? You’ll read plenty about recession-proof stocks these days, and I do think there are some very good picks out there. They’re companies that produce things we just can’t live without. Things that people carry on needing even during the toughest of times.\nSo a supermarket like Tesco seems a clear choice to me. Then we have Unilever and Reckitt Benckiser , which between them are responsible for a vast range of consumer brands with wide coverage of cleaning and health products. A medical emergency like Covid-19 reminds us that the big pharmaceutical firms are vital parts of our first-world lives too. So GlaxoSmithKline and AztraZeneca will always feature in my list of defensive stocks for times of recession. Profitable portfolio\nIt’s no surprise that this group of stocks would have made for a good investing strategy. GlaxoSmithKline is the poorest performer in 2020 with a share price fall of 9%. At the other end, we have Reckitt Benckiser, which has soared 22%, with AstraZeneca not far behind on 14%. A portfolio of these five stocks would have had you on financially safe ground this year.\nBut, you might be thinking, it’s a wee bit late for me to be extolling the virtues of these stocks. Surely it’s too late to talk about how to invest for a recession after the recession has already been going for months. Waiting for a market crash, then selling all your fallen stocks and buying safer ones at higher prices? Well, that wouldn’t help your bottom line very much at all. Timing the recession?\nWhen is the best time to move to recession-proof stocks? I say that time is all the time . I think the best investing strategy during a recession is the same as the best investing strategy always. If you base your lifetime investing strategy on Warren Buffett’s first rule of investing, which says “ Never lose money “, you should end up with safe, defensive, stocks that can see you through any recession and help provide for a comfortable retirement.\nAnd if you add Buffett’s second rule to your strategy, you could be set for life: “ Never forget rule number one .” 5 Stocks For Trying To Build Wealth After 50\nMarkets around the world are reeling from the coronavirus pandemic…\nAnd with so many great companies trading at what look to be ‘discount-bin’ prices, now could be the time for savvy investors to snap up some potential bargains.\nBut whether you’re a newbie investor or a seasoned pro, deciding which stocks to add to your shopping list can be daunting prospect during such unprecedented times.\nFortunately, The Motley Fool is here to help: our UK Chief Investment Officer and his analyst team have short-listed five companies that they believe STILL boast significant long-term growth prospects despite the global lock-down…\nYou see, here at The Motley Fool we don’t believe “over-trading” is the right path to financial freedom in retirement; instead, we advocate buying and holding (for AT LEAST three to five years) 15 or more quality companies, with shareholder-focused management teams at the helm.

      "text": "Posted By: Editor Some want direct government aid. Others want tax breaks. Many want protection against lawsuits. Nursing homes have been the center of America’s coronavirus pandemic, with more than 62,000 residents and staff dying from Covid-19 at nursing homes and other long-term care facilities, about 40 percent of the country’s virus fatalities. Now the lightly regulated industry is campaigning in Washington for federal help that could increase its profits. Some of the country’s largest nursing-home companies — including those with long histories of safety violations and misusing public funds — have assembled a fleet of lobbyists, many with close ties to the Trump administration. Eliezer Scheiner, a nursing-home owner and major donor to President Trump, recently retained Brian Ballard , a friend of the president who used to lobby on behalf of Mr. Trump’s business. Genesis Healthcare, the largest nursing-home chain in the United States, hired two former top White House aides, including Jim Schultz , a former special assistant to Mr. Trump. LifeCare Centers of America, whose Kirkland, Wash., facility had the country’s first coronavirus outbreak in March, brought on four former Republican Senate aides. The industry’s main trade group enlisted Haley Barbour, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee. Image Brian Ballard in 2018. He was hired as a lobbyist by a nursing-home operator who is a major donor to President Trump. Credit… M. Scott Mahaskey, via Politico It is hardly unusual for embattled industries to seek help from Washington. But the fact that individual nursing-home companies are hiring lobbyists, not just relying on trade associations, reflects the ambitious nature of the industry’s mobilization. Nursing homes are not only seeking assistance in surviving a pandemic. They are also capitalizing on the public health crisis to pursue a long-sought wish list that, until now, has remained mostly out of reach. The industry has already notched one potentially lucrative victory. LifeCare Centers and others successfully pushed the Trump administration in July to exempt nursing-home companies from a 2017 law that curtailed how much interest big companies can deduct from their taxes. The change could effectively lower the federal tax bills for many nursing-home operators. Nursing homes — many of which were in deep financial trouble even before the pandemic — are also on the hunt for government cash infusions through the federal economic rescue that became law in March, as well as any future stimulus bills. The industry has received about $7.6 billion in federal grants through the federal economic stimulus package, according to the American Health Care Association, an industry group, and will soon get another $5 billion. Nursing homes have also received an estimated $11 billion more in government loans and advance Medicare payments, according to an analysis of federal data by Good Jobs First, a progressive research group. Executives at Genesis, which has reported 1,500 deaths at its homes nationwide, told investors last week that the company had received nearly $190 million in federal grants and was looking for more. On Saturday, Mr. Trump seemed to indicate that more aid was on its way. “We will announce additional measures to protect nursing home residents in the coming days,” he said at a news conference at his golf club in Bedminster, N.J. “We’ve worked very hard with nursing home companies.” Among the industry’s biggest goals is for the federal government to block residents and their families from suing nursing homes for wrongful deaths and other malpractice claims — even those that have nothing to do with Covid-19. Senate Republicans introduced legislation last month that would make it virtually impossible for families whose relatives died from neglect or the coronavirus to hold nursing homes accountable in court. The legislation would apply retroactively to 2019 and extend through 2024. The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, has said the liability-protection law — which would also apply to a range of other industries worried about being sued if they reopen during the pandemic — must be included in any new economic stimulus package . The Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell’s former chief of staff is among the lobbyists who have championed the liability-protection bill. Credit… Anna Moneymaker for The New York Times Mr. McConnell’s former chief of staff Kyle Simmons was recently hired by the American Health Care Association, the powerful trade group representing for-profit nursing-home companies, to work on legislative issues related to the virus, according to federal lobbying records. He is among the lobbyists who have championed the bill in the Senate, according to three people with direct knowledge of the matter. Nursing-home operators have argued that they should not be held responsible for the deaths of residents, including many who were already uniquely vulnerable to the virus, because they were hit by a pandemic that no one could have anticipated. Many homes have argued that they struggled to get testing kits and other essential protective gear that might have helped them contain the spread. “Without legal protections, many nursing homes and assisted-living communities could shut down completely, threatening access to long-term care for thousands of individuals and precious jobs for caregivers,” said Beth Martino, a spokeswoman for the American Health Care Association. But even before the coronavirus, many nursing homes had poor records when it came to safety and staffing. A report this spring from the Government Accountability Office found that the industry failed to maintain basic infection-control standards like quarantining sick residents or requiring frequent hand washing. Some of the nursing homes with high death tolls from the virus have been cited by regulators for safety and other problems. LifeCare Centers, for example, paid $145 million in 2016 to resolve allegations, without admitting wrongdoing, that its nursing homes had bilked Medicare. After the virus spread among LifeCare patients and staff in Kirkland, government inspectors faulted the home for failing to properly notify the state authorities. Davis Lundy, a spokesman for LifeCare Centers, said the company is “fully compliant with any requirements of the settlement” with the Justice Department. He saidthat staff at the Kirkland home “deserve high praise, not criticism,” and that the company was appealing the decision by the state health department. The industry has successfully lobbied at least 20 states to gain immunity from lawsuits in state courts. But the federal Safe to Work Act would go further than anything on the state level because it would cover lawsuits that had nothing to do with the coronavirus and apply to deaths that occurred months before the virus began spreading. “The industry is using this epidemic to win a get-out-of-jail-free card,” said Toby Edelman, a senior lawyer at the Center for Medicare Advocacy, a nonprofit legal assistance group for the elderly. A resident being removed in April from the Southeast Nursing and Rehabilitation Center in San Antonio, where 18 residents have died during the pandemic. Credit… Eric Gay/Associated Press With Mr. Trump in the White House, nursing-home companies have won numerous victories. In 2017, the Trump administration, under pressure from industry groups, adjusted how nursing homes were fined for violating federal rules. Under the new guidance, the average fine dropped more than 30 percent, according to an analysi s last year of federal data by Kaiser Health News. The Trump administration also proposed weakening infection-control rules, imposed under President Barack Obama, that required all nursing homes to employ at least one person who specialized in preventing infections. In November, a group of nursing-home operators gathered in a ballroom at the InterContinental hotel in Midtown Manhattan to raise more than $3 million for Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign. Mr. Trump stood onstage and thanked Mr. Scheiner, who donated $750,000, the most of any attendee, “for doing such an incredible job.” Mr. Scheiner, who owns more than 20 nursing homes, received a thunderous round of applause, according to video of the event . Mr. Scheiner and his company, TL Management, have faced serious problems. This year, he settled allegations, made by a federally appointed bankruptcy court trustee, that he and his partner fraudulently transferred more than $1 million in assets out of a nursing-home operator before it filed for bankruptcy. (Mr. Scheiner denied wrongdoing.) This year, 43 residents have died at homes owned by Mr. Scheiner, according to state records reviewed by The New York Times. In May, Mr. Scheiner donated an additional $50,000 to a different political action committee bankrolling Mr. Trump’s campaign, federal records show. TL Management has hired four lobbyists. One is Mr. Trump’s friend Mr. Ballard. Another is Emily Hargan, whose husband is a top official at the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the nation’s nursing homes. The lobbyists’ mandate was to help win legal immunity for the industry and to secure financial aid from the federal government, records show. Since the pandemic began, Mr. Scheiner’s homes have received roughly $26 million in federal grants and loans, according to Good Jobs First. Mr. Ballard’s lobbying firm had an additional goal: to help cut TL Management’s tax bill, according to two people familiar with the matter. The 2017 overhaul of the federal tax code limited how much interest companies can deduct from their taxes. TL Management, along with LifeCare Centers and other large nursing-home companies, asked the Treasury Department to exempt the industry from some of those limits. On July 28, they got what they wanted: Treasury proposed allowing companies that operate a “qualified residential living facility” to be able to deduct a larger amount of interest from their taxes. But the protection against lawsuits may be a higher-stakes issue for Mr. Scheiner’s network of nursing homes. The Southeast facility, owned by the Trump donor Eliezer Scheiner, has been sued by families of some of the residents who died. Credit… Matthew Busch for The New York Times At Mr. Scheiner’s Southeast Nursing and Rehabilitation Center in San Antonio, which has been cited by regulators for failing to control infections three years in a row, 18 residents have died during the pandemic. That is the most deaths at any nursing home in the city, according to The Times analysis of state records. The families of some of those residents have sued. In a lawsuit last month, the family of Jose Velasquez, who died after contracting the coronavirus, said Southeast staff repeatedly minimized the gravity of his illness. An hour before he died, employees told the family that Mr. Velasquez was “doing fine and showed no symptoms of the disease,” according to the lawsuit. Texas is not among the 20 states that have shielded nursing homes from pandemic-related lawsuits. But if the federal liability bill passes, the families’ lawsuits would most likely be derailed. At the November fund-raiser in New York, Mr. Trump also paid tribute to a longtime friend, Ruby Schron, who in 2003 agreed to pay more than $700 million to buy dozens of properties from Mr. Trump. “Ruby, I want to thank you,” Mr. Trump said at the event. “You’re a great guy.” In 2010, Mr. Schron and SavaSeniorCare, one of the country’s largest nursing-home chains, agreed to pay $14 million to settle Justice Department allegations that they solicited kickbacks from a pharmacy to provide drugs to nursing-home patients. In a separate 2015 case, the Justice Department accused Sava of routinely submitting bogus claims to Medicare. The case is ongoing. The Justice Department said in a 2010 court filing that Mr. Schron “controlled” Sava . In a 2016 report prepared with the input of Sava’s financial advisers, the bond-rating firm S&P Global said Mr. Schron “effectively owns most of the equity in Sava.” Annaliese Impink, a spokeswoman for Sava, said Mr. Schron “is not involved in the operations” of the company. “He is the landlord of several of the centers.” This year, the Trump administration has provided Sava with roughly $74 million in loans and grants through the economic stimulus package, according to Good Jobs First. In June, the Democratic-controlled House committee overseeing the federal response to the coronavirus said it would be examining the records of the five largest for-profit nursing-home chains, including Sava, Genesis and LifeCare. It is looking at how the companies are spending the federal stimulus money they have already received. As it looks for victories on Capitol Hill, the industry is trying to soften its image. Mark Parkinson, who runs the American Health Care Association, told members this summer that the group was preparing a $15 million ad campaign in Washington. “We hope to shape the national conversation,” he wrote.

      "text": "No Comments Does Elliott Wave really work?\nThis is the question that has crossed the minds of a majority of traders and investors. The internet is full of examples that show beautifully prepared charts to persuade traders that Elliott Waves do work. It is made to appear that if one learns the three straight-forward rules of the Elliott Wave Theory, and some basic Fibonacci Ratio relationships, they are ready to take the plunge and become enormously profitable. But in practice, most of these traders fail, and then they ask this question of themselves, does Elliott Wave really work! And I mean ‘really’. What are the rules of Elliott Wave Theory? Wave 3 cannot be the shortest of the three impulses The second wave cannot trade below the bottom of wave 1 Corrective wave 4 cannot enter the price area of wave 1\nLooks simple enough right?\nThen there are the exceptions. There are some formations such as the leading and ending diagonals where we can relax the third rule shown above. That means, if we are in these situations, we can allow wave 4 to overlap wave 1.\nThe trader is also shown several guidelines. For example, there is the principle of alternation. If wave 2 is simple, then wave 4 can become complex, and vice versa. Read my post where I explain Elliott Waves in more detail.\nWhere does all this lead to? Some think if they learn all of these rules and guidelines, then they can make Elliott Waves work for them. Yet, why do so many traders fail? No matter how far down the wrong road you are on, it is never too late to turn back! So take charge of your trading career. Learn Elliott Waves and see how that knowledge impacts your results.\nThere are some who say that Elliott Waves work some of the times, but do not work at other times. When it fails to work for them, they blame the theory. Some others point to the subjectivity involved, and ask how can we be sure that it is a third wave of an impulse, or a C wave of a correction! When there is subjectivity, when they cannot codify it is as an open-and-shut case, they say it won’t work for them.\nI recently read a response to this question that was quite amusing. A person claiming to be a former ‘quant’ trader has said that just because you can make money using a tool does not mean that the tool works!\nAnd the debate will go on, until thy kingdom come! What is my own opinion on this subject?\nElliott Wave Analysis is an approach to trading. You should understand how to USE that approach properly in order to be successful. A faulty application of the tool will result in less-than-satisfactory results. I have an online program that teaches the correct approach of using Elliott Waves effectively. And today, 14 August 2020, I am uploading another case study of a trade that is yet to happen. This case study attempts to show how we can use Elliott Waves to position ourselves for a potential gain of over 40%. Yes, 40%. (There are students from over 25 countries that have enrolled and every one of them has said they learned new skills.)\nClearly, I am not showing what has already worked! This is something that I am hoping will work in the future. I am teaching how to USE our understanding of the Elliott Wave Principle to enter a low-risk trade for a significant gain. If it works, it will be yet another validation that Elliott Waves will work, provided you learn how to incorporate it correctly in your trading strategy. Understand that I am NOT making any predictions of the future. I am merely applying the Elliott Wave Principle the way it should, to reach my financial goals!",

(NASDAQ:MU), Mylan NV (NASDAQ:MYL), Array Biopharma Inc (NASDAQ:ARRY) Trending Stocks: Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU), Mylan NV (NASDAQ:MYL), Array Biopharma Inc (NASDAQ:ARRY)\n Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU), lost -0.32% to $15.58.\nMicron Technology, declares the production of 8GB DDR4 NVDIMM, the companys first commercially available solution in the persistent memory category. Persistent memory delivers a unique balance of latency, bandwidth, capacity and cost, delivering ultra-fast DRAM-like access to critical data and allowing system designers to better manage overall costs. With persistent memory, system architects are no longer forced to sacrifice latency and bandwidth when accessing critical data that must be preserved.\nAs data centers evolve to handle the massively growing influx of data, the cost of moving data and storing it away from the CPU becomes increasingly prohibitive, creating the need for a new generation of faster, more responsive solutions. Persistent memory, a new addition to the memory hierarchy, allows greater flexibility in data administration by providing non-volatile, low latency memory closer to the processor. With NVDIMM technology, Micron delivers a powerful persistent memory solution capable of meeting many of recentlys biggest computing challenges.\nMicrons NVDIMM starts to address some of the difficult architectural challenges facing CIOs recently, and is ideal for applications such as big data analytics, storage appliances, RAID cache, In-Memory Databases and On Line Transaction Processing. Traditional memory architectures force system architects to sacrifice latency or bandwidth needed to access the critical data for these applications, and as a result, performance is often limited by I/O bottlenecks. Microns NVDIMM solutions deliver architectures suited to meet the demands of applications that require high performance coupled with frequent access to large data sets while being sensitive to down time. In the event of a power failure or system crash, Microns NVDIMM solution provides an onboard controller that safely transfers data stored in DRAM to the onboard non-volatile memory, thereby preserving the data that would otherwise be lost.\nMicron Technology, Inc. provides semiconductor systems worldwide. It operates in four segments: Compute and Networking Business Unit, Mobile Business Unit, Storage Business Unit, and Embedded Business Unit.\nShares of Mylan NV (NASDAQ:MYL), inclined 2.80% to $51.80,\nMylan EPD in Canada – a partner of one of the worlds leading pharmaceutical companies, Mylan N.V. (NASDAQ, TASE: MYL) – recently declared the launch of MyFreshStart™ for patients taking MAVIK®, an innovative, digital medication adherence and engagement program for patients who have been prescribed MAVIK® (trandolapril) in Canada *.\nThe My Fresh Start program, offered to patients through participating pharmacies, provides tools to assist improvement compliant behaviors such as maintaining prescription refills and taking MAVIK as prescribed.\nHead of Mylan EPD in Canada Barry Hayter commented: Were excited to declare the launch of My Fresh Start for pharmacists and their patients. We know that non adherence negatively impacts health outcomes, and we believe this program provides pharmacists with a meaningful platform to discuss the importance of compliance with their patients. This new resource reinforces Mylans commitment to expand access to high quality medicine as we innovate to meet unmet needs.\nMylan N.V., through its auxiliaries, develops, licenses, manufactures, markets, and distributes generic, branded generic, and specialty pharmaceuticals worldwide. The company provides generic or branded generic pharmaceutical products in tablet, capsule, injectable, or transdermal patch forms, in addition to active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs).\nFinally, Shares of Array Biopharma Inc (NASDAQ:ARRY), 0.76% gain, and closed at $4.00.\nArray BioPharma, declared that its Chief Executive Officer, Ron Squarer, will present at the Piper Jaffray Annual Healthcare Conference in New York on Wednesday, December 2, 2015,at 1:30 p.m. Eastern Time.\nArray Bio Pharma Inc., a biopharmaceutical company, focuses on the discovery, development, and commercialization of small molecule drugs to treat patients with cancer in North America, Europe, and the Asia Pacific.

      "text": "Christy Bieber, The Motley Fool Published 8:01 a.m. ET Aug. 16, 2020 CLOSE\nExpert advice for retirees during this financially tumultuous time.\nBuzz60 Americans’ retirement confidence has dropped compared with a year ago , no surprise considering the country is in a recession and the long-term economic impact of the coronavirus remains unknown. Almost everyone faces economic trouble over the course of their career, and you can’t let these tough times affect your future as a retiree. Fortunately, you don’t have to. There are five simple steps to take throughout your life to help ensure you’re well prepared for your later years. You can take all five of these steps now. But if you’re out of work due to the coronavirus and can’t afford them all, you can complete some while you’re waiting to get back to work, and do the rest once you’re rehired. 1. Estimate the retirement income you’ll need First things first: The goal of investing for retirement is to ensure you have what you need to cover your costs once you have no more paychecks coming in. But it’s impossible to know how much to save until you know the amount of money you’ll have to withdraw from your investment accounts. If you’re close to retirement, you can make a sample budget to get a clear picture of what you’ll spend. Next, determine how much you’ll get from Social Security, pension income, and any sources other than your investments. Any gap between your spending needs and income from these other sources will need to be filled by investment account withdrawals. Retirement savers: Worried about stock market bubble? You might not have to do anything If you’re many years away from leaving work, it can be hard to make a budget with any accuracy, but there are other techniques to determine the income you’ll likely require. One option is to assume you’ll need around 80% to 90% of the salary you were making right before leaving work. Figure out your final salary by using your current income and assuming a 2% annual raise (so if you make $50,000, next year you’d need $51,000, and $52,020 after that, and so on). Then, assume you’ll need about 80% of it at a minimum, and you’ll have your target number. 2. Determine how much to save to hit your goal After you’ve determined the amount of income your investment accounts need to generate, you can estimate the size of your nest egg. If you plan to follow the 4% rule (withdrawing that share of your investment account balance annually when you first retire and subsequently increasing withdrawals only to keep pace with inflation), figuring out how big your account balance needs to be is as simple as multiplying your desired investment income by 25.\n(Photo: Getty Images) If you’ve determined you need your investments to produce $35,000 a year in income to supplement Social Security, you’ll need $875,000 in your investment accounts. You can use an online calculator to determine how much you need to invest monthly to hit that target number. 3. Decide what kind of investment accounts to use Once you know how much to save, the next step is to determine where to save it. For most people, it makes sense to use a tax-advantaged account such as a 401(k) or IRA. If you have access to a 401(k) at work, investing in it is probably the easiest approach. And your employer may even match some of the contributions you make. However, if your 401(k) offers limited investment options or charges high fees, you may want to invest only enough to get the employer match and put the rest of your retirement contributions into an IRA. COVID-19 retirement changes: Make sure they don’t cost you You’ll also need to think about whether you want to invest in a traditional IRA or 401(k), which provides tax savings up front since you make contributions with pre-tax money, or whether you’d prefer a Roth account that takes contributions with after-tax dollars but enables money to grow tax free. There are some substantial benefits to a Roth, including the ability to reduce potential future taxes on Social Security benefits. But it can be harder to make large contributions since you don’t get the tax break up front. 4. Automate your investments Armed with the knowledge of how much you need to save and what account you need to save it in, you can take the most important step: setting up automatic contributions to your account. ‘Insulin or groceries’: How reduced unemployment affects struggling Americans from California to Mississippi When you establish an automatic recurring contribution for the amount necessary to hit your target savings goal (and stick with it), you ensure you’re successful. Saving isn’t something you have to actively work at; it just happens without your input. 5. Build a diversified portfolio Finally, once your money is invested, you’ll want to put an appropriate percentage of it into the stock market based on your age. And you’ll want a diverse mix of investments that limit your risk while giving you the best chance at earning reasonable returns. If you aren’t sure how to buy individual stocks (or your plan doesn’t allow it), investing in index funds that track the performance of the stock market is a simple approach. Get started ASAP Although you’ll need to save a substantial amount for your later years, you can work on it all your life. For most people, if you follow these five steps and start as early as possible, hopefully you’ll leave the working world with a hefty sum in your retirement accounts .

      "text": "President Trump Donald John Trump President Trump’s brother, Robert Trump, dies at 71 Trump to take part in each day at GOP convention: reports Trump breaks with CDC director on potential for ‘worst fall’ amid pandemic, flu season MORE is seeking to build up some much-needed momentum with the landmark peace agreement announced Thursday between Israel and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), arguing it shows his negotiating skills are changing the Middle East in a positive way for U.S. interests.\nThe accord marks the first time the president has secured a major foreign policy agreement with overwhelming bipartisan support, and it builds political capital at a critical time when his campaign is grappling with disapproval over how Trump has handled the coronavirus pandemic and the staggering unemployment rate.\nWhile it is unclear whether the deal will have an impact on voters focused on the economy and he pandemic, GOP strategists say it breathes new life into Trump’s 2020 messaging.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“It certainly gives some legitimacy when [the president] hails himself as the great negotiator,” said GOP strategist Doug Heye. “It gives Trump substance behind a claim that he’s been making for a long time, where he just didn’t have it.”\nNews of the deal comes just days after Vice President Joe Biden Joe Biden Tlaib votes ‘no’ on Democratic party platform Trump breaks with CDC director on potential for ‘worst fall’ amid pandemic, flu season Battle looms over Biden health care plan if Democrats win big MORE announced Sen. Kamala Harris Kamala Harris Tlaib votes ‘no’ on Democratic party platform Sunday shows preview: Mail-in voting, USPS funding dominates political debate before conventions Will Kamala Harris follow Al Gore’s lead on climate change commitment? MORE (D-Calif.) as his running mate.\nMultiple GOP strategists said all positive news is helpful to the president, who is trailing Biden in polls and is seen as the underdog in the race. The deal gives something for the White House to tout in the coming debates and GOP convention.\nTrump is seeking to convince voters to give him four more years, and the accomplishment gives him something real to tout as he attacks the Biden-Obama foreign policy.\n“His out-of-the-box thinking and style has been criticized by all of them, and yet he continues to deliver,” said GOP strategist Ford O’Connell. “I think that this is a weapon for him, particularly in what we expect to be such a tight close race.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nFew see foreign policy usurping healthcare and the economy as an election-year issue.\n“I really think the political effects of this are going to be limited,” said Brendan Steinhauser, co-founder of public relations firm Steinhauser Strategies. “I think that most Americans are not going to be paying attention to this as historic as it is.”\nBut strategists argued it still gives a boost to Trump, arguing that it undercuts past criticism from Democrats that the president destroyed any possibility of striking peace in the region over his decision to move the U.S. Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem — a move that was widely condemned by Palestinians.\nThey say it proves he can have a positive impact, and some are hopeful that other Arab states, including Saudi Arabia, might follow the UAE move as the U.S. and Israel seek to further corner Iran.\n“This deal is a significant step towards building a more peaceful, secure and prosperous Middle East,” Trump told reporters Thursday. “Now that the ice has been broken, I expect more Arab and Muslim countries will follow the United Arab Emirates’ lead.”\nGOP strategists repeatedly pointed to positive press coverage across different outlets. They highlighted the op-ed by New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman in which the Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter hailed the accord as “huge.”\n“It’s a geopolitical earthquake,” wrote Friedman, a frequent critic of Trump. “The agreement brokered by the Trump administration…was exactly what Trump said it was in his tweet: a ‘HUGE breakthrough.’”\nOther commentators have been more measured, noting that the UAE and Israel have been cooperating for years, undercutting the idea that the breakthrough is really a giant change.\nTrump has repeatedly sought to make a play for both the pro-Israel community, a group that includes social conservatives and evangelicals, and Jewish voters.\nHe’s described himself as the strongest president for Israel in U.S. history, and Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu Benjamin (Bibi) Netanyahu MORE has showered him with praise.\nYet Trump has also been criticized for a rise in anti-Semitism during his presidency, undermining any hopes of winning over more Jewish voters.\nTrump in 2017 was equivocal in his reaction to violence between white supremacist and neo-Nazi groups and those protesting them in Charlottesville, Va., stating that there were “very fine people” on both sides.\n“I don’t think the president’s role in this deal can erase his role domestically in encouraging an atmosphere that has spawned more anti-Semitism, more racism, and more antagonism against people of color than we have than we’ve experienced in the last decade,” Democratic strategist Basil Smikle told The Hill.\nStill, the deal, which marks the first time a major Arab state has recognized Israel since the 1994 Israel-Jordan Peace Treaty, is receiving praise from both sides of the aisle.\n“Israel and the United Arab Emirates have taken a historic step to bridge the deep divides of the Middle East,” Biden said in a statement.\nGOP strategists said the fact that Democrats are not criticizing the deal is further proof its merits. They also note that Biden in a statement sought to take credit for it.\n“The coming together of Israel and Arab states builds on the efforts of multiple administrations to foster a broader Arab-Israeli opening, including the efforts of the Obama-Biden administration to build on the Arab Peace Initiative,” Biden’s statement continues.\nThe strategists knocked this idea, arguing that three previous administrations sought to broker a peace deal and only Trump has succeeded.\n“Biden tried to make the case that yes the president deserves credit, but somehow they set the ball in motion and that’s just not true,” said O’Connell. “This is a historic breakthrough in an area that both Republicans and Democrats have tried to move the ball forward. And now, the Trump administration has something concrete.” Post navigation",

      "text": "Posted By: Editor\nPresident Donald Trump sought to reframe the fall election two days before the Democratic National Convention, arguing on Saturday that key economic and pandemic indicators were moving in his favor, while attempting to shift blame for US Postal Service funding problems to Democrats and refusing to acknowledge his administration’s efforts to undermine the agency three months before Election Day.\n© Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images US President Donald Trump answers questions during a press conference in the Brady Briefing Room of the White House in Washington, DC, on August 14, 2020. (Photo by Nicholas Kamm / AFP) (Photo by NICHOLAS KAMM/AFP via Getty Images)\nThe President’s finger-pointing and misinformation about the upheaval within the USPS was his latest attempt to rewrite history in real time into a version that better suits his reelection narrative. Load Error\nHe’s long done the same with the economy. Glossing over the fact that the US economy contracted at a 32.9% annual rate during the second quarter and tens of millions of Americans have lost their jobs as a result of the pandemic, Trump claimed Saturday that the US is witnessing “the fastest economic recovery in American history” because of the “foundation” set by his administration. He touted an all-time high in retail sales and gains in the stock market as evidence of a rebound that would sway voters to support him in November.\nView Trump and Biden head-to-head polling\n“If I win, which — I hope to win, how can you not when you see numbers like this both on the virus and on the economy?” Trump said during a Saturday news conference at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey. “I mean, we should win. We should all keep this incredible thing going. And I built it once and I’ll build it again.” Blaming Democrats\nAt a time when his administration is engulfed in controversy over its efforts to curtail USPS operations when the demand for mail-in ballots has grown exponentially due to the pandemic, Trump tried to blame the agency’s funding woes on Democrats. He said they are blocking negotiations on the next stimulus package due to an impasse over the Democrats’ proposed aid package for states that drained their coffers while fighting the pandemic.\nOn Friday, the postal service, which is mired in longstanding funding problems, warned nearly all 50 states and Washington, DC, that mail-in ballots may not be received by election offices in time to be counted.\nCNN and other news organizations reported Friday that the postal service has reduced operating hours in several states and was removing letter collection boxes off streets in some states, according to union officials.\n(As of Saturday afternoon, representatives at the USPS’ national headquarters in Washington were still unable to confirm whether they would stop removing letter collection boxes until after the election.)\nTrump admitted last week during a Fox News interview that he opposes at least part of the proposed emergency funding infusion for the post office, because he believes the uptick in mail-in ballots during the pandemic will favor Democrats. In the NPR/PBS/Marist poll released last week, 62% of Joe Biden’s supporters say they plan to cast their ballot by mail, while 72% of Trump supporters say they will vote in person.\nDuring the Fox interview, Trump said Democrats want $25 billion for the USPS as part of the stimulus negotiations with $3.5 billion directed toward mail-in voting. He then repeated his baseless claim that mail-in voting will lead to voter fraud, stating that the $3.5 billion will go toward “something that’ll turn out to be fraudulent.”\nRevealing his own political calculations as they relate to post office funding, Trump went on to say in that Fox interview that if Democrats don’t get that funding “that means you can’t have universal mail-in voting.” (House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has said the bipartisan board of governors that runs the USPS — a board whose members are appointed by Trump — requested the proposal of $25 billion for USPS in the next stimulus bill).\nOn Saturday, Trump continued to sow doubts about the integrity of the November election, claiming without any evidence that “universal mail-in voting is going to be catastrophic” and would “make our country a laughingstock all over the world.”\nHe claimed to not know the details of the scaling back of postal services under new Postmaster General Louis DeJoy, a GOP donor and Trump fundraiser, calling DeJoy a “fantastic man” who “wants to make the post office great again.” On Friday, CNN reported that the USPS inspector general is reviewing controversial policy changes by DeJoy, including eliminating overtime for workers.\n“I don’t know what he’s doing. I can only tell you he’s a very smart man,” Trump said Saturday.\nDemocrats are considering bringing the House of Representatives back into session as early as next week to discuss the issues facing the USPS, according to CNN reporting late Saturday.\nFormer President Bill Clinton criticized the changes made by the postmaster general on Saturday.\n“We expect our elected officials to protect the right to vote and to ensure every vote is counted. This attack on the Postal Service —an institution as old as the Republic itself and depended upon, and trusted by, millions of Americans— is designed to ensure that neither is done,” Clinton tweeted. Trump claims progress on the pandemic\nTrump tried to strike an upbeat tone on Saturday as he gave an update on coronavirus case positivity rates and hospitalization rates. He cited improvements in the test turnaround times by commercial labs and said the administration has intensified its focus on shielding the most at-risk individuals in nursing homes and long-term care facilities, by rushing protective gear and rapid testing equipment to those sites.\nAs of Saturday, there were at least 5.3 million coronavirus cases in the US and more than 169,000 US deaths. The seven-day average of new cases was trending down in 22 states as of Saturday, but last week, the US was continuing to average more than 1,000 deaths per day .\nAs the Trump administration continues its push for students to return to school for in-person instruction, new guidance from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the Covid-19 rates in children are steadily increasing , creating new fears for parents. An analysis by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Children’s Hospital Association also found that there has been a 90% increase in Covid-19 cases among children over the four-week period from July 9 to August 6.\nTrump also said Saturday he did not agree with the assessment of CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield that America could be primed for “the worst fall, from a public health perspective, we’ve ever had,” if people don’t follow the CDC guidelines on basic safety measures like wearing masks and avoiding crowds.\n“You can’t compare it to 1917, that was incredible. That was the worst ever by far,” Trump said Saturday, referring to the flu pandemic that caused tens of millions of deaths worldwide in 1918 and 1919. “No, I don’t agree with that.”\n“I do believe that Americans, many are wearing masks, which is a good thing,” Trump added, with no hint of irony, after he held out so long on wearing a mask in public and many of his most loyal GOP governors have refused to impose mask mandates in their states. “When you look at the numbers, the way the numbers are coming out, I mean, it’s very impressive when you see what’s happening…. We’ve done it right. We closed it up.”\nHe then immediately pivoted to the economy, which he is counting on to save his reelection prospects: “Our economy is going to set records — if stupid people aren’t elected next year, we’re going to have one of the greatest years that we’ve ever had.” Video: Nancy Pelosi calls Trump’s executive actions unconstitutional (CNN) Nancy Pelosi calls Trump’s executive actions unconstitutional What to watch next",

      "text": "Andy Crowder August 16, 2020 at 08:30 Options\nI have a trade for you today on Walmart earnings.\nOur strategy has allowed us to reap over 825% in gains since October 2017 (click here for details). That’s right, 825% up.\nYou see, years ago, I never thought it made sense to trade earnings. It was a foreign concept due to numerous limitations (commissions, liquidity, no weekly expirations). Trading earnings announcements just didn’t make sense from an efficiency standpoint.\nWell, things have dramatically changed.\nAdd 52 weekly expiration cycles, a variety of highly liquid products and the clarity of a once unknown calculation . . . and we now have the opportunity to trade earnings news in an efficient, informed and highly profitable manner. The Key: Expected Move\nToday I want to focus on the “unknown calculation” . . . It’s a major advance in the way all traders approach the market, especially during earnings season.\nThe unknown calculation? Expected move .\nWell, I’m sure most of you are asking, what is “expected move”?\nExpected move is the price movement the market expects during a given expiration cycle. It’s the key to successfully trading earnings announcements. Fortunately, now we have tools that allow us to see, in real-time, the expected move for any given underlying stock around its earnings release.\nThis one calculation gives us the supply and demand for any individual security in real-time. That is incredible information to have if you are trading during earnings season. Walmart Earnings . . . and Other Trades\nDuring the coming week I will be sending out potential trades in Walmart, Home Depot, Target, Lowe’s and several others . To learn how to use this approach and to get details on the trades, please click here to reserve a spot at my upcoming briefing.\nLet’s look at Walmart earnings (WMT).\nAs expected, implied volatility (IV) is high as we move closer to the uncertainty of the WMT earnings announcement. We ALWAYS want to see heightened levels of IV when seeking trading opportunities around earnings. Increased levels of IV means inflated options prices . . . basically, that means we can sell options for more premium than usual.\nWe have several tools at our disposal to figure out what the expected move is for WMT immediately following the Walmart earnings announcement. You can see the expected move embedded in the options chain on the Tastyworks platform. The expected move is from $125 to just over $139, for an expected move or range of $14.\nKnowing that the expected move is $14 gives us the opportunity to utilize a variety of strategies based on our market assumptions in WMT (bullish, bearish or neutral).\nI tend to stick with risk-defined, neutral-based strategies like an iron condor. This one strategy has been the leading factor in the majority of the 825% gains I have reaped since starting the strategy just under three years ago.\nSince we know the expected move in WMT is $14 after Walmart earnings are reported, we can create a range-bound trade around the expected range as seen in the options chain above. And as long as WMT shares trade within that range immediately following the WMT earnings announcement, we should be able to buy back the spread for a nice profit due to volatility crush.\nThe probability of that occurring is roughly 80% on the downside and over 80% on the upside.\nThe increase in volatility, followed by the rapid decline, affords us the opportunity to take advantage of some nice profits as we trade Walmart earnings.\nI hope this short article on expected move gives you the insight you need to trade earnings and make sound judgments on each and every earnings trade you decide to take on.\nIf you would like to know more about the strategy, risk-management techniques and more importantly, how we have reaped over 825% since we started to trade earnings, please click here. I’ll take all of your questions during this deep-dive event. ",

(NYSE:RES), gained 8.73% to $11.58.\nRPC, declared its unaudited results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2015. RPC provides a broad range of specialized oilfield services and equipment primarily to independent and major oilfield companies engaged in the exploration, production and development of oil and gas properties throughout the United States and in selected international markets.\nFor the quarter ended September 30, 2015 revenues reduced 53.0 percent to $291.9 million contrast to $620.7 million in the third quarter of last year. Revenues reduced contrast to the preceding year due to lower activity levels and pricing for our services. Operating loss for the quarter was $51.5 million contrast to operating profit of $106.7 million in the preceding year. Net loss for the quarter was $35.2 million or $0.16 loss per share, contrast to net income of $64.9 million or $0.30 diluted earnings per share last year.

Cost of revenues reduced due to lower costs resulting from lower activity levels, reduced personnel and incentive compensation, and price reductions from suppliers, partially offset by the impact of increasing service intensity. Additionally, as a result of a change in accounting estimate implemented during 2015, replacement parts totaling about $12.6 million were charged to cost of revenues rather than being capitalized. In addition, RPC recognized $3.8 million in additional cost of revenues during the third quarter of 2015 due to write-downs in the value of materials and supplies which are slow-moving or can no longer be effectively utilized in providing our services to customers. As a percentage of revenues, cost of revenues raised due to competitive pricing for our services and inefficiencies resulting from lower activity levels, in addition to higher maintenance and repair expenses due to increasing service intensity.\nRPC, Inc. provides a range of oilfield services and equipment for oil and gas companies involved in the exploration, production, and development of oil and gas properties in the United States, Africa, Canada, China, Eastern Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, and New Zealand.\nShares of First Niagara Financial Group Inc.

The national personal finance publication asked banks to verify information about account terms, ATM networks, branch hours, mobile-app features, and other perks. MONEY then chose the best banks based largely on maintenance fees and ease of waiving them, ATM fees, and checking account yields; savings account yields, preferential loan terms, ATM-fee reimbursements, and geographic reach were considered tiebreakers.\nFirst Niagara Financial Group, Inc. operates as the bank holding company for First Niagara Bank, N.A. that provides retail and commercial banking, and other financial services to individuals, families, and businesses.\nFinally, Shares of Energy Transfer Partners LP (NYSE:ETP), 3.26% gain, and closed at $44.36.\nEnergy Transfer Partners, declared a $0.02 improvement in its quarterly distribution to $1.055 per ETP common unit ($4.22 annualized) for the third quarter ended September 30, 2015.\nThe quarterly distribution of $1.055 represents a distribution improvement of $0.32 per common unit on an annualized basis, or 8.2%, contrast to the third quarter of 2014 and represents an annualized distribution improvement of $0.08 per common unit contrast to the second quarter of 2015.

      "title": "October surprise: Will war with Iran be Trump’s election eve shocker?",
      "text": "Posted By: Editor\nWas Donald Trump’s January 3rd drone assassination of Major General Qasem Soleimani the first step in turning the simmering Cold War between the United States and Iran into a hot war in the weeks before an American presidential election? Of course, there’s no way to know, but behind by double digits in most national polls and flanked by ultra-hawkish Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Trump is a notoriously impetuous and erratic figure. In recent weeks, for instance, he didn’t hesitate to dispatch federal paramilitary forces to American cities run by Democratic mayors and his administration also seems to have launched a series of covert actions against Tehran that look increasingly overt and have Iran watchers concerned about whether an October surprise could be in the cards.\nMuch of that concern arises from the fact that, across Iran, things have been blowing up or catching fire in ways that have seemed both mysterious and threatening. Early last month, for instance, a suspicious explosion at an Iranian nuclear research facility at Natanz, which is also the site of its centrifuge production, briefly grabbed the headlines. Whether the site was severely damaged by a bomb smuggled into the building or some kind of airstrike remains unknown. “A Middle Eastern intelligence official said Israel planted a bomb in a building where advanced centrifuges were being developed,” reported the New York Times. Similar fiery events have been plaguing the country for weeks. On June 26th, for instance, there was “a huge explosion in the area of a major Iranian military and weapons development base east of Tehran.” On July 15th, seven ships caught fire at an Iranian shipyard. Other mysterious fires and explosions have hit industrial facilities, a power plant, a missile production factory, a medical complex, a petrochemical plant, and other sites as well. Advertisement:\n“Some officials say that a joint American-Israeli strategy is evolving — some might argue regressing — to a series of short-of-war clandestine strikes,” concluded another report in the Times.\nSome of this sabotage has been conducted against the backdrop of a two-year-old “very aggressive” CIA action plan to engage in offensive cyber attacks against that country. As a Yahoo! News investigative report put it: “The Central Intelligence Agency has conducted a series of covert cyber operations against Iran and other targets since winning a secret victory in 2018 when President Trump signed what amounts to a sweeping authorization for such activities, according to former U.S. officials with direct knowledge of the matter… The finding has made it easier for the CIA to damage adversaries’ critical infrastructure, such as petrochemical plants.”\nMeanwhile, on July 23rd , two U.S. fighter jets buzzed an Iranian civilian airliner in Syrian airspace, causing its pilot to swerve and drop altitude suddenly, injuring a number of the plane’s passengers. Advertisement:\nFor many in Iran, the drone assassination of Soleimani — and the campaign of sabotage that followed — has amounted to a virtual declaration of war. The equivalent to the Iranian major general’s presidentially ordered murder, according to some analysts, would have been Iran assassinating Secretary of State Pompeo or Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley, although such analogies actually understate Soleimani’s stature in the Iranian firmament.\nIn its aftermath, Iran largely held its fire, its only response being a limited, telegraphed strike at a pair of American military bases in Iraq. If Soleimani’s murder was intended to draw Iran into a tit-for-tat military escalation in an election year, it failed. So perhaps the U.S. and Israel designed the drumbeat of attacks against critical Iranian targets this summer as escalating provocations meant to goad Iran into retaliating in ways that might provide an excuse for a far larger U.S. response.\nSuch a conflict-to-come would be unlikely to involve U.S. ground forces against a nation several times larger and more powerful than Iraq. Instead, it would perhaps involve a sustained campaign of airstrikes against dozens of Iranian air defense installations and other military targets, along with the widespread network of facilities that the United States has identified as being part of that country’s nuclear research program. Advertisement:\nThe “art” of the deal in 2020\nIn addition to military pressure and fierce sanctions against the Iranian economy, Washington has been cynically trying to take advantage of the fact that Iran, already in a weakened state, has been especially hard hit by the Covid-19 pandemic. Those American sanctions have, for instance, made it far harder for that country to get the economic support and medical and humanitarian supplies it so desperately needs, given its soaring death count. Advertisement:\nAccording to a report by the European Leadership Network ,\n“Rather than easing the pressure during the crisis, the U.S. has applied four more rounds of sanctions since February and contributed to the derailing of Iran’s application for an IMF [International Monetary Fund] loan. The three special financial instruments designed to facilitate the transfer of humanitarian aid to Iran in the face of secondary sanctions on international banking transactions… have proven so far to have been one-shot channels, stymied by U.S. regulatory red tape.”\nTo no avail did Human Rights Watch call on the United States in April to ease its sanctions in order to facilitate Iran’s ability to grapple with the deadly pandemic, which has officially killed nearly 17,000 people since February (or possibly, if a leaked account of the government’s actual death figures is accurate, nearly 42,000). Advertisement:\nIran has every reason to feel aggrieved. At great political risk, President Hassan Rouhani and Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei agreed in 2015 to a deal with the United States and five other world powers over Iran’s nuclear research program. That accord, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), accomplished exactly what it was supposed to do: it led Iran to make significant concessions, cutting back both on its nuclear research and its uranium enrichment program in exchange for an easing of economic sanctions by the United States and other trade partners.\nThough the JCPOA worked well, in 2018 President Trump unilaterally withdrew from it, reimposed far tougher sanctions on Iran, began what the administration called a campaign of “maximum pressure” against Tehran, and since assassinating Soleimani has apparently launched military actions just short of actual war. Inside Iran, Trump’s confrontational stance has helped tilt politics to the right , undermining Rouhani, a relative moderate, and eviscerating the reformist movement there. In elections for parliament in February, ultraconservatives and hardliners swept to a major victory .\nBut the Iranian leadership can read a calendar, too. Like voters in the United States, they know that the Trump administration is probably going to be voted out of office in three months. And they know that, in the event of war, it’s more likely than not that many Americans — including, sadly, some hawkish Democrats in Congress, and influential analysts at middle-of-the-road Washington think tanks — will rally to the White House. So unless the campaign of covert warfare against targets in Iran were to intensify dramatically, the Iranian leadership isn’t likely to give Trump, Pompeo, and crew the excuse they’re looking for. Advertisement:\nAs evidence that Iran’s leadership is paying close attention to the president’s electoral difficulties, Khamenei only recently rejected in the most explicit terms possible what most observers believe is yet another cynical ploy by the American president, when he suddenly asked Iran to reengage in direct leader-to-leader talks. In a July 31st speech , the Iranian leader replied that Iran is well aware Trump is seeking only sham talks to help him in November. (In June, Trump tweeted Iran: “Don’t wait until after the U.S. Election to make the Big deal! I’m going to win!”) Indeed, proving that Washington has no intention of negotiating with Iran in good faith, after wrecking the JCPOA and ratcheting up sanctions, the Trump administration announced an onerous list of 12 conditions that would have to precede the start of such talks. In sum, they amounted to a demand for a wholesale, humiliating Iranian surrender. So much for the art of the deal in 2020.\nOctober surprises, then and now\nMeanwhile, the United States isn’t getting much support from the rest of the world for its thinly disguised effort to create chaos, a possible uprising, and the conditions to force regime change on Iran before November 3rd. At the United Nations, when Secretary of State Pompeo called on the Security Council to extend an onerous arms embargo on Iran, not only did Russia and China promise to veto any such resolution but America’s European allies opposed it, too. They were particularly offended by Pompeo’s threat to impose “snapback” economic sanctions on Iran as laid out in the JCPOA if the arms embargo wasn’t endorsed by the council. Not lost on the participants was the fact that, in justifying his demand for such new U.N. sanctions, the American secretary of state was invoking the very agreement that Washington had unilaterally abandoned. “Having quit the JCPOA, the U.S. is no longer a participant and has no right to trigger a snapback at the U.N.,” was the way China’s U.N. ambassador put it.\nThat other emerging great power has, in fact, become a major spoiler and Iranian ally against the Trump administration’s regime-change strategy, even as its own relations with Washington grow grimmer by the week. Last month, the New York Times reported that Iran and China had inked “a sweeping economic and security partnership that would clear the way for billions of dollars of Chinese investments in energy and other sectors, undercutting the Trump administration’s efforts to isolate the Iranian government.” The 18-page document reportedly calls for closer military cooperation and a $400 billion Chinese investment and trade accord that, among other things, takes direct aim at the Trump-Pompeo effort to cripple Iran’s economy and its oil exports. Advertisement:\nAccording to Shireen Hunter , a veteran Middle Eastern analyst at Georgetown University, that accord should be considered a world-changing one, as it potentially gives China “a permanent foothold in Iran” and undermines “U.S. strategic supremacy in the [Persian] Gulf.” It is, she noted with some alarm, a direct result of Trump’s anti-Iranian obsession and Europe’s reluctance to confront Washington’s harsh sanctions policy.\nOn June 20th, in a scathing editorial , the Washington Post agreed, ridiculing the administration’s “maximum pressure” strategy against Iran. Not only had the president failed to bring down Iran’s government or compelled it to change its behavior in conflicts in places like Syria and Yemen, but now, in a powerful blow to U.S. interests, “an Iranian partnership with China… could rescue Iran’s economy while giving Beijing a powerful new place in the region.”\nIf, however, the traditional Washington foreign policy establishment believes that Trump’s policy toward Iran is backfiring and so working against U.S. hegemony in the Persian Gulf, his administration seems not to care. As evidence mounts that its approach to Iran isn’t having the intended effect, the White House continues apace: squeezing that country economically, undermining its effort to fight Covid-19, threatening it militarily, appointing an extra-hardliner as its “special envoy” for Iran, and apparently ( along with Israel ) carrying out a covert campaign of terrorism inside the country.\nOver the past four decades, “October surprise” has evolved into a catch-all phrase meaning any unexpected action by a presidential campaign just before an election designed to give one of the candidates a surprise advantage. Ironically, its origins lay in Iran. In 1980, during the contest between President Jimmy Carter and former California Governor Ronald Reagan, rumors surfaced that Carter might stage a raid to rescue scores of American diplomats then held captive in Tehran. (He didn’t.) According to other reports, the Reagan campaign had made clandestine contact with Tehran aimed at persuading that country not to release its American hostages until after the election. (Two books, “ October Surprise ” by Gary Sick, a senior national security adviser to Carter, and “ Trick or Treason ” by investigative journalist Bob Parry delved into the possibility that candidate Reagan, former CIA Director Bill Casey, and others had engaged in a conspiracy with Iran to win that election.) Advertisement:\nConsider it beyond irony if, this October, the latest election “surprise” were to take us back to the very origins of the term in the form of some kind of armed conflict that could only end terribly for everyone involved. It’s a formula for disaster and like so many other things, when it comes to Donald J. Trump, it can’t be ruled out.\nCopyright 2020 Bob Dreyfuss\nTo stay on top of important articles like these, sign up to receive the latest updates from TomDispatch.com here . Post navigation",

      "text": "Posted By: Editor\nMESA, Ariz. (AP) — Yasser Sanchez has twice worked to defeat Joe Biden’s bids for the vice presidency by building support for Republican candidates among his fellow members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. It wasn’t hard.\nNow the lifelong Republican finds himself in the surprising position of supporting Biden — and repelled from his party, he says, by President Donald Trump.\n“We’re taught to be steady, to be basically the opposite of the way he’s lived his life,” Sanchez said.\nSanchez’s view isn’t as unusual as the Trump campaign would like.\nWhile many conservative-leaning religious voters warmed to him long ago, Trump has struggled to win over Latter-day Saints. His penchant for foul language clashes with the church’s culture teaching modesty and self-restraint, and his isolationist foreign policy is anathema to a faith spreading rapidly around the world.\nIt hasn’t helped that Trump has made a show of feuding with Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, among the best known members of the church.\nOnce just a headache for the White House, Trump’s relative weakness with Latter-day Saints is now a growing political liability. His standing has slumped in several pivotal states, including Arizona, where members of the faith make up 6% of the population. Many are clustered around Phoenix, areas where Republicans have struggled to hold their ground in the Trump era.\nThis past week the Trump campaign launched its Latter-day Saints for Trump Coalition, sending Vice President Mike Pence to Mesa, a suburb of Phoenix, for the kickoff. Pence, who often serves as Trump’s emissary to religious conservatives, appealed to church members’ opposition to abortion rights and longstanding concerns over religious liberty.\nTrump “has stood for the religious freedom of every American of every faith every day of this administration,” Pence told the group of about 200 people.\nLast month, the president’s son, Donald Trump Jr., hosted a conference call with reporters to commemorate Pioneer Day, a church holiday celebrating the arrival of the first church settlers in Utah’s Salt Lake Valley in 1847. Trump Jr., said he was in Utah at the time for a fishing trip. Story continues\nStill, signs of discontent were clear. More than 200 people identifying themselves as Republicans who belong to the church published an open letter Wednesday declaring their opposition to Trump and calling him “the antithesis of so much the Latter-day Saints community believes.”\nTo be sure, Latter-day Saints have traditionally voted Republican and are likely to remain part of the GOP coalition. Clustered in solidly Republican states, they have long been a major force in GOP primaries and local politics across the West, but they have not held much sway in national elections.\nTrump won Arizona in 2016 by 91,000 votes. There are about 436,000 Latter-day Saints in Arizona, according to church statistics. Many live in Phoenix’s East Valley suburbs popular with young families, including Gilbert, Chandler and Mesa, which traces its modern history to a settlement founded by pioneers from the faith in the 1800s.\nIn recent elections, political consultants have considered these areas a barometer of swing voters, including women and college-educated white voters who have recently shifted Democratic. In 2018, several neighborhoods east of Phoenix popular with church members voted both for Republican Gov. Doug Ducey and Democratic Sen. Kyrsten Sinema.\n“From the time we’re young we’re taught — as are all Christians — that we’re supposed to love God and love our neighbor,” said Kathy Varga, a 39-year-old speech therapist from Mesa. “I don’t see that happening right now. I just see the country becoming more divided.”\nVarga reluctantly voted for Trump in 2016 because she was worried about Democrat Hillary Clinton putting liberal justices on the Supreme Court. Now Varga says he believes Trump is threatening government institutions and the Constitution. She plans to vote for Biden, even though she disagrees with many of his policies, because “the most important thing right now is to unify the country.”\nIt’s unclear precisely how common Varga’s view is among her faith. In the 2018 midterm elections, about two-thirds of voters who are members of the church nationwide favored Republicans. But Latter-day Saints were less likely than other traditionally Republican religious groups to approve of the way Trump was doing his job.\nAmong members of the faith, 67% voted for Republicans, and 56% said they approved of Trump’s job performance. By comparison, 80% of white evangelical Christians nationwide voted for Republican candidates, and nearly as many said they approve of Trump, according to an analysis of 1,528 midterm voters who are members of the faith, based on data from VoteCast, a broad national survey conducted for The Associated Press by NORC at the University of Chicago.\nEven Latter-day Saints who turned out to hear Pence this past week acknowledged they were disappointed in Trump’s infidelity or uncouth language. But they also viewed it as a tolerable consequence of electing a straight-talking man unafraid to ruffle feathers.\nAlthough Trump rarely speaks about his faith or attends church services, these supporters said they believed he was a defender of religious freedoms, which is of paramount importance to members of a faith that settled in what is now Utah to escape persecution.\n“We’re able to continue practicing our religion. That’s how our country was founded,” said Norma Hastings, a 71-year-old church member from Gilbert. She said she thinks Pence “keeps Trump on the right road.”\nJenn Crandall, a 48-year-old pianist from Mesa, said she looks to other figures in the administration and the campaign for connection.\n“I like how hard working his kids are, his wife,” Crandall said. “He’s a family guy.”\nBiden’s campaign is also targeting Latter-day Saints in Arizona and elsewhere. A Latter-day Saints for Joe group was formed more than a year ago. In a virtual town hall for church members on Saturday, campaign surrogates tied Biden’s economic, health care and immigration agendas to church teachings on self reliance, family values and refuge.\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints “prioritizes caring for the poor. It prioritizes strong families, a strong moral code, sacrifice,” said Eric Biggart, co-chair of LDS Democrats who lives in Salt Lake City. “To me, it’s hard to be a Republican and a member of the church at the same time.”\nThe church does not back candidates or political parties.

      "text": "Posted By: Editor\nPresident Donald Trump sought to reframe the fall election two days before the Democratic National Convention, arguing on Saturday that key economic and pandemic indicators were moving in his favor, while attempting to shift blame for US Postal Service funding problems to Democrats and refusing to acknowledge his administration’s efforts to undermine the agency three months before Election Day.\n© Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images US President Donald Trump answers questions during a press conference in the Brady Briefing Room of the White House in Washington, DC, on August 14, 2020. (Photo by Nicholas Kamm / AFP) (Photo by NICHOLAS KAMM/AFP via Getty Images)\nThe President’s finger-pointing and misinformation about the upheaval within the USPS was his latest attempt to rewrite history in real time into a version that better suits his reelection narrative.\nHe’s long done the same with the economy. Glossing over the fact that the US economy contracted at a 32.9% annual rate during the second quarter and tens of millions of Americans have lost their jobs as a result of the pandemic, Trump claimed Saturday that the US is witnessing “the fastest economic recovery in American history” because of the “foundation” set by his administration. He touted an all-time high in retail sales and gains in the stock market as evidence of a rebound that would sway voters to support him in November.\nView Trump and Biden head-to-head polling\n“If I win, which — I hope to win, how can you not when you see numbers like this both on the virus and on the economy?” Trump said during a Saturday news conference at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey. “I mean, we should win. We should all keep this incredible thing going. And I built it once and I’ll build it again.” Blaming Democrats\nAt a time when his administration is engulfed in controversy over its efforts to curtail USPS operations when the demand for mail-in ballots has grown exponentially due to the pandemic, Trump tried to blame the agency’s funding woes on Democrats. He said they are blocking negotiations on the next stimulus package due to an impasse over the Democrats’ proposed aid package for states that drained their coffers while fighting the pandemic.\nOn Friday, the postal service, which is mired in longstanding funding problems, warned nearly all 50 states and Washington, DC, that mail-in ballots may not be received by election offices in time to be counted.\nCNN and other news organizations reported Friday that the postal service has reduced operating hours in several states and was removing letter collection boxes off streets in some states, according to union officials.\n(As of Saturday afternoon, representatives at the USPS’ national headquarters in Washington were still unable to confirm whether they would stop removing letter collection boxes until after the election.)\nTrump admitted last week during a Fox News interview that he opposes at least part of the proposed emergency funding infusion for the post office, because he believes the uptick in mail-in ballots during the pandemic will favor Democrats. In the NPR/PBS/Marist poll released last week, 62% of Joe Biden’s supporters say they plan to cast their ballot by mail, while 72% of Trump supporters say they will vote in person.\nDuring the Fox interview, Trump said Democrats want $25 billion for the USPS as part of the stimulus negotiations with $3.5 billion directed toward mail-in voting. He then repeated his baseless claim that mail-in voting will lead to voter fraud, stating that the $3.5 billion will go toward “something that’ll turn out to be fraudulent.”\nRevealing his own political calculations as they relate to post office funding, Trump went on to say in that Fox interview that if Democrats don’t get that funding “that means you can’t have universal mail-in voting.” (House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has said the bipartisan board of governors that runs the USPS — a board whose members are appointed by Trump — requested the proposal of $25 billion for USPS in the next stimulus bill).\nOn Saturday, Trump continued to sow doubts about the integrity of the November election, claiming without any evidence that “universal mail-in voting is going to be catastrophic” and would “make our country a laughingstock all over the world.”\nHe claimed to not know the details of the scaling back of postal services under new Postmaster General Louis DeJoy, a GOP donor and Trump fundraiser, calling DeJoy a “fantastic man” who “wants to make the post office great again.” On Friday, CNN reported that the USPS inspector general is reviewing controversial policy changes by DeJoy, including eliminating overtime for workers.\n“I don’t know what he’s doing. I can only tell you he’s a very smart man,” Trump said Saturday.\nDemocrats are considering bringing the House of Representatives back into session as early as next week to discuss the issues facing the USPS, according to CNN reporting late Saturday.\nFormer President Bill Clinton criticized the changes made by the postmaster general on Saturday.\n“We expect our elected officials to protect the right to vote and to ensure every vote is counted. This attack on the Postal Service —an institution as old as the Republic itself and depended upon, and trusted by, millions of Americans— is designed to ensure that neither is done,” Clinton tweeted. Trump claims progress on the pandemic\nTrump tried to strike an upbeat tone on Saturday as he gave an update on coronavirus case positivity rates and hospitalization rates. He cited improvements in the test turnaround times by commercial labs and said the administration has intensified its focus on shielding the most at-risk individuals in nursing homes and long-term care facilities, by rushing protective gear and rapid testing equipment to those sites.\nAs of Saturday, there were at least 5.3 million coronavirus cases in the US and more than 169,000 US deaths. The seven-day average of new cases was trending down in 22 states as of Saturday, but last week, the US was continuing to average more than 1,000 deaths per day .\nAs the Trump administration continues its push for students to return to school for in-person instruction, new guidance from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the Covid-19 rates in children are steadily increasing , creating new fears for parents. An analysis by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Children’s Hospital Association also found that there has been a 90% increase in Covid-19 cases among children over the four-week period from July 9 to August 6.\nTrump also said Saturday he did not agree with the assessment of CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield that America could be primed for “the worst fall, from a public health perspective, we’ve ever had,” if people don’t follow the CDC guidelines on basic safety measures like wearing masks and avoiding crowds.\n“You can’t compare it to 1917, that was incredible. That was the worst ever by far,” Trump said Saturday, referring to the flu pandemic that caused tens of millions of deaths worldwide in 1918 and 1919. “No, I don’t agree with that.”\n“I do believe that Americans, many are wearing masks, which is a good thing,” Trump added, with no hint of irony, after he held out so long on wearing a mask in public and many of his most loyal GOP governors have refused to impose mask mandates in their states. “When you look at the numbers, the way the numbers are coming out, I mean, it’s very impressive when you see what’s happening…. We’ve done it right. We closed it up.”\nHe then immediately pivoted to the economy, which he is counting on to save his reelection prospects: “Our economy is going to set records — if stupid people aren’t elected next year, we’re going to have one of the greatest years that we’ve ever had.” Show full articles without “Continue Reading” button for {0} hours.

      "text": "WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump continues to trail Democratic challenger Joe Biden nationally as more than 60 percent of voters say America’s response to the coronavirus has been unsuccessful and just one-in-five believe the U.S. economy is on solid footing.\n© Provided by NBC News\nThose are the major findings from the latest national NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll , which was conducted during the ongoing pandemic that has killed more than approximately 170,000 Americans and as the presidential race enters a new phase, with the party conventions beginning on Monday just days after Biden’s selection of Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., as his running mate .\nAccording to the survey, Biden leads Trump nationally by 9 points among registered voters, 50 percent to 41 percent, and the former vice president holds double-digit advantages over Trump on the coronavirus, immigration, health care, race relations and uniting the country.\nWhat’s more, the poll shows Harris with a higher net personal rating than either Trump or Biden possess.\nStill, Trump maintains his lead over Biden on the economy — which the poll finds is voters’ top issue heading into the election — and the president’s overall numbers have improved from last month, although the movement is within the survey’s margin of error.\nBut what also stands out in the poll is how stable Biden’s lead over Trump has been during the past year, with it ranging from 6 to 11 points in the last nine NBC News/WSJ surveys.\n“Clearly, Biden is in the lead. Clearly, Trump has a lot of problems,” said Democratic pollster Peter Hart, who conducted this survey with Republican pollster Bill McInturff.\nBut Hart stresses that the election is “not a done deal,” especially with a majority of voters saying they’re either uncertain or pessimistic about the job Biden would do as president.\n“Biden is well-known, but not known well, and people are looking for direction on that,” Hart said in previewing the upcoming Democratic convention.\nAs for Trump’s challenge ahead of his convention that begins on Aug. 24, it’s expanding support beyond his committed Republican base, with an approval rating and ballot position stuck in the low 40s.\n“That seems to me to be short of where he needs to be to win an election,” said McInturff, the GOP pollster.\nBiden’s 9-point national lead in the horserace is down from his 11-point edge in last month’s NBC News/WSJ poll.\nIn the current poll, the former vice president maintains his advantages with Blacks (88 percent back him versus 8 percent for Trump), Latinos (57 percent to 31 percent), voters ages 18-34 (54 percent to 30 percent), independents (49 percent to 25 percent), whites with college degrees (58 percent to 35 percent), women (57 percent to 36 percent) and seniors (50 percent to 43 percent).\nTrump, meanwhile, leads among all whites (49 percent to 42 percent), men (47 percent to 43 percent) and whites without college degrees (59 percent to 27 percent).\nIn the combined 11 battleground states — Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin — Biden is ahead of Trump by 7 points, 49 percent to 42 percent.\nFifty-eight percent of Biden voters say their support for the former vice president is more against Trump, while 38 percent say it’s more forBiden.\nBy contrast, 74 percent of Trump voters are more for the president, versus 20 percent who are more against Biden.\nInterest in the upcoming election continues to be sky-high, with 79 percent of all voters registering either a “9” or “10” on a 10-point scale in interest, which is greater than interest in previous presidential elections at this same point in time.\nEighty-five percent of Republicans say they have high interest in the upcoming election, versus 83 percent of Democrats who say the same. More view Kamala Harris positvely\nThe NBC News/WSJ poll was conducted partially during and after Biden selected Kamala Harris as his vice-presidential running mate on Tuesday, Aug. 11.\nThirty-nine percent of voters have a positive impression of Harris, while 35 percent have a negative view of her.\nThat overall net score for Harris (+4) is higher than the scores for Vice President Mike Pence (-5), Biden (-6), and President Trump (-12), but it’s lower than former President Barack Obama’s (+20).\nStill, Biden and Trump voters are divided over Harris, with 71 percent of Biden voters holding a positive view of her, versus just 4 percent of Trump voters.\nAs for views of both Trump and Biden, a combined 41 percent of voters say they are either “optimistic and confident” or “satisfied and hopeful” about the job Trump would do as president if he wins in November, while 59 percent are “uncertain and wondering” or “pessimistic and worried.”\nThat’s compared with 46 percent who are optimistic and hopeful about Biden, and 52 percent who are uncertain and pessimistic. Majority say response to coronavirus has been unsuccessful\nA combined 61 percent of voters believe America’s response to the coronavirus has been unsuccessful, including 39 percent who say it’s been “very” unsuccessful and another 22 percent who say it’s been “somewhat” unsuccessful.\nBy comparison, just 36 percent of voters think the response has been successful, including 28 percent who say it’s been “somewhat” successful and 8 percent who say it’s been “very” successful.\nNot surprisingly, there’s a stark partisan divide on these numbers, with 84 percent of Democrats and 58 percent of independents saying the response has been unsuccessful, versus 59 percent of Republicans who believe it has been successful.\nForty percent of voters say they approve of Trump’s handing of the coronavirus, while 58 percent disapprove.\nLast month, those numbers were 37 percent approve, 59 percent disapprove.\nThe president’s overall job rating stands at 44 percent approve, 53 percent disapprove — another slight improvement from July (when it was 42 percent approve, 56 percent disapprove).\nAnd on the economy, only 22 percent describe current economic conditions as either “excellent” or “good”— down from 29 percent who said this back in June.\nBy contrast, a whopping 77 percent say the economy is either “only fair” or “poor,” which is up from 68 percent two months ago. Trump leads on economy, crime; Biden leads on all other issues\nDespite those grim economic numbers, Trump holds a double-digit advantage on which candidate would do a better job handling the economy, with 48 percent picking the president versus 38 percent siding with Biden.\nTrump also leads on crime, 43 percent to 39 percent.\nBut Biden has the edge on all the other issues in the poll, including having strong leadership qualities (43 percent to 39 percent), foreign policy (49 percent to 39 percent), immigration (49 percent to 38 percent), health care (50 percent to 34 percent), the coronavirus (49 percent to 33 percent), bringing the country together (49 percent to 26 percent) and race relations (53 percent to 29 percent).\nAsked which one or two of these issues are the most important in deciding their vote for president, the top combined responses are the economy (51 percent), bringing the country together (43 percent), having strong leadership qualities (34 percent), health care (29 percent) and the coronavirus (27 percent).\n“For Donald Trump, this election is about the economy, full stop. For voters, this election is about more than that – with their health and bringing the country together also major considerations,” said Democratic pollster Jeff Horwitt of Hart Research Associates, who also helped conduct this poll. Democrats hold 5-point lead on congressional preference\nFinally, the NBC News/WSJ poll shows Democrats holding a 5-point advantage on congressional preference, with 47 percent of voters preferring Democrats in control of Congress, versus 42 percent who want Republicans in charge.\nThat’s higher than the 4-point edge Democrats held in July, but it’s down from the 11-point advantage the party enjoyed in June.\nThe NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll was conducted Aug. 9-12 of 900 registered voters – more than half of whom were reached by cell phone – and it has an overall margin of error of plus-minus 3.3 percentage points.

      "text": "Stephen Miller is the architect of Donald Trump’s extreme policies on immigration.\nAnd leaked emails have shown him pushing white-power ideology cloaked in pseudo-science.\nSo how did an affluent kid from the California suburbs — who liked mobster movies and wore gold chains — get on the path that led him to where he is now?\nJean Guerrero’s new book Hatemonger: Stephen Miller, Donald Trump, and the White Nationalist Agenda follows Miller through a conservative media landscape where key figures — including right-wing radio talk-show host Larry Elder; David Horowitz, who founded the David Horowitz Freedom Center; and former Breitbart chief Steve Bannon — propelled the rise of a man who now influences who gets to be an American.\nGuerrero, who is a reporter for NPR member station KPBS, says she decided to write the book because she “wanted to understand what was motivating the man who is crafting these policies whose consequences I had been covering from the busiest border crossing in the country.” And Stephen Miller was a big part of that.\nStephen Miller grew up in Southern California during the 90s — at the same time Guerrero was growing up just a couple hours south of where he lived.\n“I just became all the more fascinated with trying to understand how a descendant of Jewish refugees who grew up in Southern California — how does that person become the person crafting Trump’s harshest rhetoric and policies, targeting people fleeing violence and persecution, people like his own great-grandparents?” Guerrero tells NPR.\nGuerrero has found that while Miller and Trump seem to work well together, they are different: “Stephen Miller is a true ideologue. He’s a fanatic. He believes this stuff, whereas Trump is a lot more motivated by self-interest. But you do see that these two men coming together … they’ve been able to mutually benefit each other in a very unique way. In part, because Stephen Miller gets Donald Trump.”\nGuerrero says she repeatedly asked for the White House to participate in her research and reporting for the book, but that they ultimately did not. Interview Highlights\nOn how Larry Elder influenced Stephen Miller\nLarry Elder is this black radio talk show host who was — he calls himself the “Sage from South Central.” And at the time, and through today, he was pushing this idea that systemic racism against black people and people of color, in general, is kind of a figment of our imaginations. And that, you know, the problems of the black communities and people of color are due to a lack of self-determination rather than systemic issues. And Stephen Miller, from a very young age, read Larry Elder’s book, The 10 Things You Can’t Say in America, and just loved it. And, like many other white people listening to Larry Elder, they felt that his ideas validated a lot of their racist beliefs and allowed them, provided them, with a framework for having these beliefs and not perceiving themselves to be racist — because of the fact that Larry is a black man. Larry tells me that the first time that Steve Miller called into his show ranting against multiculturalism and against his school’s alleged lack of patriotism, Larry was just very impressed with how articulate Stephen was. …\nHe was really skilled at regurgitating the talking points of other talk show hosts that he’d been listening to, like Rush Limbaugh. And so he just decided he was going to invite him on. He was very impressed with the way that Stephen Miller dressed. He was just overall really taken with this young teenager and how passionate he was. And he decided to give him a platform and let him on the show pretty much whenever he wanted.\nOn how Miller attracted attention in his high school\nHe was talking about how students shouldn’t have to pick up their trash because that’s what the custodians are there to do. He says that’s what we pay the janitors to do. And a lot of the students watching this speech that he gave thought of it as pretty classist and racist because of the fact that there’s only a handful of custodians [at the school] and they were all people of color. But, you know, his friends tell me that from a very young age, Stephen Miller would always say really outrageous things, just trying to get a rise out of people — which he did when, during that speech, one of the student government leaders was afraid that a riot was about to start, a race riot. And she felt that he had intended to create this chaos of people screaming at each other and getting really riled up.\nHow being on the Larry Elder show gained him the attention of David Horowitz\nDavid Horowitz, he is a former Marxist turned right-wing radical who kind of dedicated much of his life to fostering young conservatives like Stephen Miller — and teaching them the weapons of the civil rights movement from which he came, and teaching them how to use the language of the civil rights movement to attack it. So, painting white men as victims of discrimination based on their skin color, calling liberals and people of color racists and oppressors. And David Horowitz finds Stephen Miller during kind of a difficult time in [Stephen’s] life. His family had had to move from a very affluent part of town to a less affluent part. So he was feeling kind of displaced. And this is when David Horowitz comes into his life, you know, starts inviting him over to his house and introducing him to the idea that Stephen Miller had to save the United States from certain destruction in the form of the Democratic Party and its alliances with Muslims and other people of color who David Horowitz believes are out to destroy civilization.\n[It’s] apparent from private correspondence that David Horowitz shared with me for the book, where you could see for years, David Horowitz shaping Stephen Miller’s career throughout college, getting him his first job on Capitol Hill, shaping [Donald] Trump’s rhetoric and policies through Miller. And he introduces him from a very young age to this idea that everything that we hold dear as Americans — you know, equality and freedom — that all of these things are thanks to white men and that there’s this unfair war on whiteness. … Stephen Miller was really taken with this idea. And you see Stephen Miller becoming radicalized. I truly see him as a case study involved in indoctrination through David Horowitz and the influence that he had on Stephen Miller.\nOn his time at Duke and his response to accusations of rape against lacrosse players\nHe was repeatedly drawn to racial controversies, primarily, you know, arguing against multiculturalism as some kind of existential threat to America and claiming that ideas of racism are simply racial paranoia and that there isn’t really any racism. And just singling out his black classmates — at one point [he] became very obsessed with the Duke lacrosse scandal, where a black woman accused several Duke lacrosse players of having raped her. And those accusations were ultimately found to be false.\nBut during the investigation, when people were trying to get to the bottom of what had happened, Stephen Miller rushed to the defense of the white players, saying that they were being targeted simply because of their white skin color. … You see him getting invited to talk on national television shows and you see kind of Stephen Miller really doubling down and tripling down, especially after the charges ended up dropped. It’s like for him, it served as evidence that he’d been right all along. And so he starts to realize that this extremism that David Horowitz introduced him to is actually a potential path to power. He had always been seen as kind of a pariah, kind of a fringe figure. His views were offensive to people, but people just kind of rolled their eyes and thought, well, this guy can’t do any harm, I mean, he’s just so out there. But you see him actually being very effective with the media.\nOn his connection to Steve Bannon\nSteve Bannon, he remembers when he met Stephen Miller, he remembered listening to his voice on the Larry Elder show in Los Angeles. You know, like so many other key figures who played a key role in shaping Trumpism, he had heard Stephen Miller. So he decides to help Stephen Miller get a platform for his ideas through the right-wing blog Breitbart, which Bannon was the head of at the time. And so, initially Stephen Miller had had some trouble on Capitol Hill getting his ideas through to journalists. Like, at first, he had been trying to derail the nomination to the Supreme Court of Sonia Sotomayor — the first woman of Latin American heritage to be nominated — by saying that her Latin American heritage would interfere with her ability to be an unbiased judge. And people just kind of, again, rolled their eyes at him, didn’t listen to him. But Steve Bannon comes in and tells Stephen Miller that he can help shape coverage at Breitbart….\nStephen Miller, I mean, he was given free reign over the writers of Breitbart. He was encouraged to shape their coverage, essentially. And so you see Stephen Miller sending the writers links to white nationalist and white supremacist literature, including websites like American Renaissance, which David Horowitz tells me he thinks that he introduced Stephen Miller to. It’s a website that pumps out misleading Black- and brown-crime statistics to paint Black and brown people as innately more violent than white people. And so you see Breitbart doing stories on this white nationalist and white supremacist literature that Stephen Miller was sending over to them.\nIt shows you just how Stephen Miller was able to bring the very combative rhetoric of right-wing talk radio and right-wing television to the White House.\nOn the Miller-Trump relationship\nFrom a very young age, Stephen Miller was expressing his desire, his fascination with violence, you know, talking about wanting to rip rapists apart bit-by-bit with his own hands, talking about wanting to watch Osama bin Laden’s body riddled with bullets, just very gory fantasies that you see Trump expressing as well. You know, when the Central Park five — black and Latino young men — were falsely accused of beating and raping a woman in Central Park, he immediately came out with an ad talking about how he wants to hate these muggers and murderers and wants them to be executed.\nAnd so Stephen Miller and Donald Trump really share this morbid fascination with violence. And that’s why you see Stephen Miller contributing these very vivid descriptions of demonizing violence into Trump’s rhetoric, you know, talking about migrants slaughtering little girls and just stuff that is supposed to make you feel afraid, and hatred towards migrants. And the other thing about their relationship is Stephen Miller consistently pushes Trump in the most aggressive direction when it comes to immigration policy and when it comes to his rhetoric. And Trump has learned to appreciate that, because whenever he has listened to a more moderate adviser, he ends up getting ridiculed by his base as — by his very hard-core base — as weak. And Trump hates that. He wants to be seen as a killer. You see him talking about this throughout his life, the importance of being a killer. And this is something that really resonates with Stephen Miller. Stephen Miller shares Trump’s instincts for violence and has his hands on the pulse of Trump’s most violent voting base because of the fact that, he’s been reading white supremacist and neo-Nazi literature for such a long time.\nStephen Miller and Donald Trump come from very similar families. You know, Stephen Miller’s dad is a real estate investor who is tangled up in numerous legal disputes and bankruptcies related to his company during Stephen Miller’s childhood. And he was described to me as being very combative. And court documents describe him as a masterpiece of evasion and manipulation and, you know, language that’s often used to describe Trump. So my sources tell me that part of the reason that Stephen Miller and Donald Trump get along so well is Stephen Miller grew up with a man who was very similar to Trump. And he knows how to how to get along with Trump. And he sees him almost like another father figure. …\nTrump truly believes that Stephen Miller is a key player for him. And you see him leaning on him more and more in this time of crisis, during the pandemic. He believes that he can no longer tout a strong economy and he’s got this public health crisis on his hands. And so he’s leaning more and more on the demonization strategies of Stephen Miller that have proved previously so effective for him. Post navigation",

Here’s your weekly digest of the Globe’s latest insights and analysis from the pros, stock tips, portfolio strategies plus what investors need to know for the week ahead. Dividend stocks are rallying, beating indexes at last Dividend stocks have been roaring back to life in August, outgunning major indexes and giving some hope to income-loving investors that the upbeat trend is just beginning, David Berman writes. The FTSE Canada High Dividend Yield Index, which is heavily focused on the big banks, telecom companies and pipelines, has risen 7 per cent since the end of July. The S&P/TSX Composite Index lags with a gain of just 2.6 per cent over the same period. The U.S. picture looks almost as bright. Is the recent strong performance by dividend-paying stocks just a blip? Peter Vanderlee, a portfolio manager at New York’s ClearBridge Investments, says he believes that a few factors now working in favour of dividend stocks could have lasting power. Read more here. Story continues below advertisement Rob Carrick: ‘Can you recommend an ETF of companies that will survive and thrive in the pandemic?’ A novel twist on thematic ETF investing arrived recently in the form of this reader question, Rob Carrick writes. At first, I thought to punt on this one. It’s guesswork to find sectors that will thrive as a result of the pandemic and, even if I could identify one, there’s the problem of getting in too late. And then I thought of an old-school ETF in the Canadian market that holds big blue-chip companies – those with established franchises that should be able to survive the economic ups and downs ahead. iShares S&P/TSX 60 Index ETF has been around since September, 1999, and has roughly one-third of its assets in Shopify, Royal Bank of Canada, Toronto-Dominion Bank, Canadian National Railway and Enbridge. An alternative to XIU is the Vanguard FTSE Canada Index, with a portfolio of 56 large companies and a low management expense ratio of 0.06 per cent. Read more here.

Gordon Pape: Why gold’s record run isn’t over yet The pandemic has created a perfect situation set of conditions for gold prices to rise, Gordon Pape writes. At the start of the outbreak, I recommended that all portfolios hold 5 to 10 per cent of their assets in gold, and continue to maintain that advice. Gold recently moved through the US$2,000 level, then retreated amid a rise in U.S. bond yields. But the question for gold remains: how high will it go? Given the historic volatility of gold, any price target is a guesstimate at best. We could easily see a short-term pullback as profit-taking sets in. But the long-term fundamentals suggest gold is going to trend higher over the next few years. Here are some reasons why , including low interest rates, massive government stimulus and inflation risk. If you don’t have some gold stocks or funds in your portfolio, it’s time to act.

      "text": "WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump continues to trail Democratic challenger Joe Biden nationally as more than 60 percent of voters say America’s response to the coronavirus has been unsuccessful and just one-in-five believe the U.S. economy is on solid footing.\n© Provided by NBC News\nThose are the major findings from the latest national NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll , which was conducted during the ongoing pandemic that has killed more than approximately 170,000 Americans and as the presidential race enters a new phase, with the party conventions beginning on Monday just days after Biden’s selection of Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., as his running mate .\nAccording to the survey, Biden leads Trump nationally by 9 points among registered voters, 50 percent to 41 percent, and the former vice president holds double-digit advantages over Trump on the coronavirus, immigration, health care, race relations and uniting the country.\nWhat’s more, the poll shows Harris with a higher net personal rating than either Trump or Biden possess.\nStill, Trump maintains his lead over Biden on the economy — which the poll finds is voters’ top issue heading into the election — and the president’s overall numbers have improved from last month, although the movement is within the survey’s margin of error.\nBut what also stands out in the poll is how stable Biden’s lead over Trump has been during the past year, with it ranging from 6 to 11 points in the last nine NBC News/WSJ surveys.\n“Clearly, Biden is in the lead. Clearly, Trump has a lot of problems,” said Democratic pollster Peter Hart, who conducted this survey with Republican pollster Bill McInturff.\nBut Hart stresses that the election is “not a done deal,” especially with a majority of voters saying they’re either uncertain or pessimistic about the job Biden would do as president.\n“Biden is well-known, but not known well, and people are looking for direction on that,” Hart said in previewing the upcoming Democratic convention.\nAs for Trump’s challenge ahead of his convention that begins on Aug. 24, it’s expanding support beyond his committed Republican base, with an approval rating and ballot position stuck in the low 40s.\n“That seems to me to be short of where he needs to be to win an election,” said McInturff, the GOP pollster.\nBiden’s 9-point national lead in the horserace is down from his 11-point edge in last month’s NBC News/WSJ poll.\nIn the current poll, the former vice president maintains his advantages with Blacks (88 percent back him versus 8 percent for Trump), Latinos (57 percent to 31 percent), voters ages 18-34 (54 percent to 30 percent), independents (49 percent to 25 percent), whites with college degrees (58 percent to 35 percent), women (57 percent to 36 percent) and seniors (50 percent to 43 percent).\nTrump, meanwhile, leads among all whites (49 percent to 42 percent), men (47 percent to 43 percent) and whites without college degrees (59 percent to 27 percent).\nIn the combined 11 battleground states — Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin — Biden is ahead of Trump by 7 points, 49 percent to 42 percent.\nFifty-eight percent of Biden voters say their support for the former vice president is more against Trump, while 38 percent say it’s more forBiden.\nBy contrast, 74 percent of Trump voters are more for the president, versus 20 percent who are more against Biden.\nInterest in the upcoming election continues to be sky-high, with 79 percent of all voters registering either a “9” or “10” on a 10-point scale in interest, which is greater than interest in previous presidential elections at this same point in time.\nEighty-five percent of Republicans say they have high interest in the upcoming election, versus 83 percent of Democrats who say the same. More view Kamala Harris positvely\nThe NBC News/WSJ poll was conducted partially during and after Biden selected Kamala Harris as his vice-presidential running mate on Tuesday, Aug. 11.\nThirty-nine percent of voters have a positive impression of Harris, while 35 percent have a negative view of her.\nThat overall net score for Harris (+4) is higher than the scores for Vice President Mike Pence (-5), Biden (-6), and President Trump (-12), but it’s lower than former President Barack Obama’s (+20).\nStill, Biden and Trump voters are divided over Harris, with 71 percent of Biden voters holding a positive view of her, versus just 4 percent of Trump voters.\nAs for views of both Trump and Biden, a combined 41 percent of voters say they are either “optimistic and confident” or “satisfied and hopeful” about the job Trump would do as president if he wins in November, while 59 percent are “uncertain and wondering” or “pessimistic and worried.”\nThat’s compared with 46 percent who are optimistic and hopeful about Biden, and 52 percent who are uncertain and pessimistic. Majority say response to coronavirus has been unsuccessful\nA combined 61 percent of voters believe America’s response to the coronavirus has been unsuccessful, including 39 percent who say it’s been “very” unsuccessful and another 22 percent who say it’s been “somewhat” unsuccessful.\nBy comparison, just 36 percent of voters think the response has been successful, including 28 percent who say it’s been “somewhat” successful and 8 percent who say it’s been “very” successful.\nNot surprisingly, there’s a stark partisan divide on these numbers, with 84 percent of Democrats and 58 percent of independents saying the response has been unsuccessful, versus 59 percent of Republicans who believe it has been successful.\nForty percent of voters say they approve of Trump’s handing of the coronavirus, while 58 percent disapprove.\nLast month, those numbers were 37 percent approve, 59 percent disapprove.\nThe president’s overall job rating stands at 44 percent approve, 53 percent disapprove — another slight improvement from July (when it was 42 percent approve, 56 percent disapprove).\nAnd on the economy, only 22 percent describe current economic conditions as either “excellent” or “good”— down from 29 percent who said this back in June.\nBy contrast, a whopping 77 percent say the economy is either “only fair” or “poor,” which is up from 68 percent two months ago. Trump leads on economy, crime; Biden leads on all other issues\nDespite those grim economic numbers, Trump holds a double-digit advantage on which candidate would do a better job handling the economy, with 48 percent picking the president versus 38 percent siding with Biden.\nTrump also leads on crime, 43 percent to 39 percent.\nBut Biden has the edge on all the other issues in the poll, including having strong leadership qualities (43 percent to 39 percent), foreign policy (49 percent to 39 percent), immigration (49 percent to 38 percent), health care (50 percent to 34 percent), the coronavirus (49 percent to 33 percent), bringing the country together (49 percent to 26 percent) and race relations (53 percent to 29 percent).\nAsked which one or two of these issues are the most important in deciding their vote for president, the top combined responses are the economy (51 percent), bringing the country together (43 percent), having strong leadership qualities (34 percent), health care (29 percent) and the coronavirus (27 percent).\n“For Donald Trump, this election is about the economy, full stop. For voters, this election is about more than that – with their health and bringing the country together also major considerations,” said Democratic pollster Jeff Horwitt of Hart Research Associates, who also helped conduct this poll. Democrats hold 5-point lead on congressional preference\nFinally, the NBC News/WSJ poll shows Democrats holding a 5-point advantage on congressional preference, with 47 percent of voters preferring Democrats in control of Congress, versus 42 percent who want Republicans in charge.\nThat’s higher than the 4-point edge Democrats held in July, but it’s down from the 11-point advantage the party enjoyed in June.\nThe NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll was conducted Aug. 9-12 of 900 registered voters – more than half of whom were reached by cell phone – and it has an overall margin of error of plus-minus 3.3 percentage points.

      "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump has found a new doctor for his coronavirus task force — and this time there’s no daylight between them.\n© Provided by Associated Press FILE – In this Aug. 12, 2020, file photo Scott Atlas, senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, speaks at a news conference in the James Brady Press Briefing Room at the White House in Washington. Trump has announced that Dr. Scott Atlas, a frequent guest on Fox News channel, has joined the White House as a pandemic adviser.(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik, File)\nTrump last week announced that Dr. Scott Atlas , a frequent guest on Fox News Channel, has joined the White House as a pandemic adviser. Atlas, the former chief of neuroradiology at Stanford University Medical Center and a fellow at Stanford’s conservative Hoover Institution, has no expertise in public health or infectious diseases. Load Error\nBut he has long been a critic of coronavirus lockdowns and has campaigned for kids to return to the classroom and for the return of college sports, just like Trump.\n“Scott is a very famous man who’s also very highly respected,” Trump told reporters as he introduced the addition. “He has many great ideas and he thinks what we’ve done is really good.”\nAtlas’ hiring comes amid ongoing tensions between the president and Drs. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious diseases expert, and Deborah Birx, the task force’s coordinator. While Birx remains closely involved in the administration’s pandemic response, both she and Fauci have publicly contradicted the rosy picture the president has painted of a virus that has now killed more than 167,000 people in the United States and infected millions nationwide.\n© Provided by Associated Press FILE – In this Aug. 12, 2020, file photo Scott Atlas, senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, left, and White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany, right, arrive ahead of President Donald Trump for a news conference at the White House in Washington. Trump has announced that Dr. Scott Atlas, a frequent guest on Fox News channel, has joined the White House as a pandemic adviser.(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik, File)\nAtlas, the sole doctor to share the stage at Trump’s pandemic briefings this past week, has long questioned polices that have been embraced by public health experts both in the U.S. and abroad. He has called it a “good thing” for younger, healthy people to be exposed to the virus, while falsely claiming children are at near “zero risk.”\nIn an April op-ed in The Hill newspaper, Atlas bemoaned that lockdowns may have prevented the development of “natural herd immunity.”\n“In the absence of immunization, society needs circulation of the virus, assuming high-risk people can be isolated,” he wrote.\nIn television appearances, Atlas has called on the nation to “get a grip” and argued that “there’s nothing wrong” with having low-risk people get infected, as long as the vulnerable are protected.\n“It doesn’t matter if younger, healthier people get infected. I don’t know how often that has to be said. They have nearly zero risk of a problem from this,” he said in one appearance . “When younger, healthier people get infected, that’s a good thing,” he went on to say, “because that’s exactly the way that population immunity develops.”\nWhile younger people are certainly at far lower risk of developing serious complications from the virus, they can still spread it to others who may be more vulnerable, even when they have no symptoms. And while their chances of dying are slim, some do face severe complications, with one study finding that 35% of young adults had not returned to normal health two weeks to three weeks after testing positive.\nBut Atlas’ thinking closely aligns with Trump’s perspective on the virus, which he has played down since its earliest days. While Trump eventually supported the lockdowns that once helped slow the disease’s spread, he has since pressured states to reopen schools and businesses as he tries to revive a battered economy before the November election.\nPublic health experts have long bemoaned Trump’s efforts to politicize the virus and have encouraged him to let doctors and scientists lead the nation’s response. But they questioned the decision to bring on Atlas, whose expertise is in magnetic resonance imaging and whose research has focused on factors impacting health care policy.\n“I think he’s utterly unqualified to help lead a COVID response,” said Lawrence Gostin, a Georgetown University law professor who specializes in public health. “His medical degree isn’t even close to infectious diseases and public health and he has no experience in dealing with public health outbreaks.”\n“Its very clear to me,” Gostin added, “that the president brought on somebody who will just be a mouthpiece for his agenda and a ‘yes’ person.” Gostin expressed concern that Trump was sidelining other doctors, including Birx and Fauci, because he had soured on their advice.\n“In the face of an epidemic that’s killing hundreds of thousands of Americans, that’s unforgivable,” he said. “You want clear independent advice from people with long experience in fighting novel pandemics and he has none of those credentials.”\nKavita Patel, a primary care physician and health policy expert who served in the Obama White House, said there’s little that can prepare a doctor for the crucible of a presidential staff, let alone working for the famously volatile Trump.\n“I expect Dr. Atlas’ time will be marked with highs and lows and hopefully he will realize that the country really needs credible expertise and guidance, not partisan bias,” said Patel. “By being partisan or political while having such an important (role), doctors undermine their credibility and ultimately dilute the role of science.”\nWhite House spokesman Judd Deere, in a statement, praised Atlas as “a world renowned physician and scholar” and dismissed questions about Atlas’ qualifications.\n“We are all in this fight together, and only the media would distort and diminish Dr. Atlas’ highly acclaimed career simply because he has come to serve the President,” he said.\nDeere declined to say how long Atlas, who is now a paid special government employee, has been advising the president, and insisted his addition would not diminish the roles of Fauci and Birx.\nPaul E. Peterson, director of the program on education policy and governance at Harvard University and a senior fellow at Hoover with Atlas, praised Atlas as “a really brilliant guy” with “a tremendous knowledge base” about the virus. Peterson said Atlas is someone who conducts ”the most rigorous and careful research before he comes to a conclusion.”\nSome colleagues have found Atlas abrasive. But Peterson, who has written several op-eds with Atlas advocating the reopening of schools and who appeared with Atlas at a White House event this past week, praised Atlas as “delightful to work with” and stressed the value of Trump having input from people with a variety of backgrounds.\n“If you get a variety of people from one perspective or one kind of training out there, that’s not desirable,” he said. “It’s extremely important to have diversity on the advisory board.”\n___\nAssociated Press writer Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar contributed to this report.

      "text": "Christy Bieber, The Motley Fool Published 8:01 a.m. ET Aug. 16, 2020 CLOSE\nExpert advice for retirees during this financially tumultuous time.\nBuzz60 Americans’ retirement confidence has dropped compared with a year ago , no surprise considering the country is in a recession and the long-term economic impact of the coronavirus remains unknown. Almost everyone faces economic trouble over the course of their career, and you can’t let these tough times affect your future as a retiree. Fortunately, you don’t have to. There are five simple steps to take throughout your life to help ensure you’re well prepared for your later years. You can take all five of these steps now. But if you’re out of work due to the coronavirus and can’t afford them all, you can complete some while you’re waiting to get back to work, and do the rest once you’re rehired. 1. Estimate the retirement income you’ll need First things first: The goal of investing for retirement is to ensure you have what you need to cover your costs once you have no more paychecks coming in. But it’s impossible to know how much to save until you know the amount of money you’ll have to withdraw from your investment accounts. If you’re close to retirement, you can make a sample budget to get a clear picture of what you’ll spend. Next, determine how much you’ll get from Social Security, pension income, and any sources other than your investments. Any gap between your spending needs and income from these other sources will need to be filled by investment account withdrawals. Retirement savers: Worried about stock market bubble? You might not have to do anything If you’re many years away from leaving work, it can be hard to make a budget with any accuracy, but there are other techniques to determine the income you’ll likely require. One option is to assume you’ll need around 80% to 90% of the salary you were making right before leaving work. Figure out your final salary by using your current income and assuming a 2% annual raise (so if you make $50,000, next year you’d need $51,000, and $52,020 after that, and so on). Then, assume you’ll need about 80% of it at a minimum, and you’ll have your target number. 2. Determine how much to save to hit your goal After you’ve determined the amount of income your investment accounts need to generate, you can estimate the size of your nest egg. If you plan to follow the 4% rule (withdrawing that share of your investment account balance annually when you first retire and subsequently increasing withdrawals only to keep pace with inflation), figuring out how big your account balance needs to be is as simple as multiplying your desired investment income by 25.\n(Photo: Getty Images) If you’ve determined you need your investments to produce $35,000 a year in income to supplement Social Security, you’ll need $875,000 in your investment accounts. You can use an online calculator to determine how much you need to invest monthly to hit that target number. 3. Decide what kind of investment accounts to use Once you know how much to save, the next step is to determine where to save it. For most people, it makes sense to use a tax-advantaged account such as a 401(k) or IRA. If you have access to a 401(k) at work, investing in it is probably the easiest approach. And your employer may even match some of the contributions you make. However, if your 401(k) offers limited investment options or charges high fees, you may want to invest only enough to get the employer match and put the rest of your retirement contributions into an IRA. COVID-19 retirement changes: Make sure they don’t cost you You’ll also need to think about whether you want to invest in a traditional IRA or 401(k), which provides tax savings up front since you make contributions with pre-tax money, or whether you’d prefer a Roth account that takes contributions with after-tax dollars but enables money to grow tax free. There are some substantial benefits to a Roth, including the ability to reduce potential future taxes on Social Security benefits. But it can be harder to make large contributions since you don’t get the tax break up front. 4. Automate your investments Armed with the knowledge of how much you need to save and what account you need to save it in, you can take the most important step: setting up automatic contributions to your account. ‘Insulin or groceries’: How reduced unemployment affects struggling Americans from California to Mississippi When you establish an automatic recurring contribution for the amount necessary to hit your target savings goal (and stick with it), you ensure you’re successful. Saving isn’t something you have to actively work at; it just happens without your input. 5. Build a diversified portfolio Finally, once your money is invested, you’ll want to put an appropriate percentage of it into the stock market based on your age. And you’ll want a diverse mix of investments that limit your risk while giving you the best chance at earning reasonable returns. If you aren’t sure how to buy individual stocks (or your plan doesn’t allow it), investing in index funds that track the performance of the stock market is a simple approach. Get started ASAP Although you’ll need to save a substantial amount for your later years, you can work on it all your life. For most people, if you follow these five steps and start as early as possible, hopefully you’ll leave the working world with a hefty sum in your retirement accounts .

      "text": "transcript Protesters Gather Outside Postmaster General’s Home Demonstrators say changes recently made by Postmaster General Louis DeJoy, a major donor to Trump campaigns, undercut the Postal Service and threaten Americans’ right to vote. [pots and pans banging, airhorns blaring] [sirens] Demonstrators say changes recently made by Postmaster General Louis DeJoy, a major donor to Trump campaigns, undercut the Postal Service and threaten Americans’ right to vote. Credit Credit… Jim Lo Scalzo/EPA, via Shutterstock Top Democrats called on Postmaster General Louis DeJoy and Robert Duncan, the chairman of the United States Postal Board of Governors, to testify before Congress before the end of the month to answer why they are advancing “dangerous new policies” that pose “a grave threat to the integrity of the election.” The demand, issued by Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the minority leader, comes as the Postal Service has warned states that it may not be able to meet their deadlines for delivering last-minute mail-in ballots. The warning is the latest development in a growing controversy over Mr. DeJoy’s handling of vote-by-mail operations as President Trump rails against the practice. “The Postmaster General — a Trump megadonor — has acted as an accomplice in the president’s campaign to cheat in the election, as he launches sweeping new operational changes that degrade delivery standards and delay the mail,” the lawmakers said in a statement. “The Postal Service itself has warned that voters — even if they send in their ballots by state deadlines — may be disenfranchised in 46 states and in Washington, D.C., by continued delays.” Under the leadership of Mr. DeJoy, the Postal Service is undergoing cuts to its operations that appear to have led to slower and less reliable delivery, creating deep unease even among some Republican lawmakers from largely rural mail-dependent states. Mr. DeJoy has framed the changes as essential to modernize an agency suffering billion-dollar losses. Democratic lawmakers have accused the president of sabotaging the Postal Service as a means of voter suppression and have started multiple investigations into the delays. Ms. Pelosi and other top Democrats in the House have begun discussing bringing lawmakers back early from their summer recess to address the issues. Protesters in Washington on Saturday called for Mr. DeJoy’s resignation, saying he was undercutting the Postal Service and threatening Americans’ ability to vote. About 100 people gathered in the wealthy residential neighborhood of Kalorama outside Mr. DeJoy’s apartment complex. Another protest was scheduled for Sunday afternoon outside Mr. DeJoy’s Greensboro, N.C., home. Copied to clipboard. Robert Trump embraced his brother after the president-elect delivered his victory speech on election night in 2016. Credit… Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images President Trump’s younger brother Robert S. Trump died Saturday night at age 71 . The White House did not say what the cause was, but he had been in poor health for some time. In a statement, the president said Robert Trump was “not just my brother, he was my best friend.” “He will be greatly missed, but we will meet again,” he said. President Trump visited his brother at a Manhattan hospital on Friday, and on Saturday, when Robert Trump was not expected to live much longer, the president called into the hospital from his Bedminster, N.J., golf club. In a statement posted to Twitter on Sunday morning, Joseph R. Biden Jr. expressed his condolences to the president and his family. He wrote, “Mr. President, Jill and I are sad to learn of your younger brother Robert’s passing. I know the tremendous pain of losing a loved one — and I know how important family is in moments like these. I hope you know that our prayers are with you all.” Robert Trump, who took blood thinners, had experienced brain bleeds after a recent fall, according to a family friend. He had no children, but he helped raise Christopher Hollister Trump-Retchin, the son of his first wife, Blaine Trump. Besides the president, his survivors include his second wife, Ann Marie Pallan, and his sisters, Maryanne Trump Barry and Elizabeth Trump Grau. His brother Fred Jr. died in 1981. “You could consider him the quietest of Trumps,” Michael D’Antonio, a Trump biographer, said. “He was glad to stay out of the spotlight.” Copied to clipboard.

Credit… Erin Schaff/The New York Times A new ABC News/Washington Post poll shows that a majority of Americans — including a quarter of Republicans — approve of Kamala Harris as Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s running mate. Over all, 54 percent of respondents said they approved of the choice of Ms. Harris, compared with just 29 percent who disapproved. The margin of error was plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. The results among Democrats were 86 percent to 8 percent, and the results among Republicans were 25 percent to 55 percent. The margin of error is higher in these subgroups. Another poll released Sunday, from NBC News and The Wall Street Journal , showed Mr. Biden leading President Trump 50 percent to 41 percent, with a margin of error of plus or minus 3.3 percentage points. That poll showed widespread disapproval of Mr. Trump’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic: 61 percent said the United States’ response had been unsuccessful. Voters said they trusted Mr. Biden more on the coronavirus, health care, race relations and immigration, but trusted Mr. Trump more on the economy. Copied to clipboard.

Credit… Anna Moneymaker for The New York Times President Trump and his supporters often argue that his sinking poll numbers don’t tell the whole story — that he will win re-election in November thanks to “hidden” voters who don’t want to admit to pollsters that they like him. These voters do exist , but both Republican and Democratic pollsters said they thought it unlikely that there were enough of them to sway the outcome of the election. There is no question that some Trump supporters won’t identify themselves to friends or co-workers. “But I’m still not convinced that not telling your business associate or the people in your Rotary Club or the people in your country club is the same thing as not telling a pollster,” said Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster. If poll respondents really were holding back, said David Winston, a pollster who works with congressional Republicans, they would probably tell pollsters they were undecided, not that they were supporting Mr. Trump’s opponent, Joseph R. Biden Jr. — and polls have not shown an unusual number of undecided voters. The possibility that Americans are hiding their true intentions from pollsters has provided an irresistible sense of intrigue to presidential elections before, even though there are few confirmed examples where it made a difference. Political experts compare such speculation to the quadrennial predictions of a brokered convention, which has not occurred since 1952. Gov. Kristi Noem of South Dakota, a close Trump ally, appears to be the first state lawmaker to decline federal support designed to aid unemployed workers. “South Dakota is in the fortunate position of not needing to accept it,” Ms. Noem said in a statement, praising the president’s leadership during the economic recovery effort. She said South Dakota had already recovered nearly 80 percent of the job losses associated with the coronavirus pandemic, and credited the state’s rebound with its decision to never shut down in the first place. “South Dakota is the only state in the nation that didn’t have extended benefits kick in because our insured unemployment rate has been the lowest in the nation,” she said. “South Dakota is open for business — that applies to our business owners and their employees.” Under an executive order signed by Mr. Trump last week, the president bypassed Congress in order to deliver emergency aid to unemployed Americans. His order diverted billions of dollars from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to unemployed Americans in order to add at least $300 a week to the benefits they are receiving from the federal government. Ms. Noem said her state would not be accepting that additional federal support. Copied to clipboard.

Smith/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images The Democratic National Convention kicks off Monday, and the uncertainties around it are legion. Can a virtual political convention unfolding in the midst of a pandemic be compelling? How will the speakers inject energy into their performances when they have no audience cheering them on? Will the American people tune in, or is everyone sick of their screens? Here are five questions to consider — around convention logistics and more traditional political issues alike — heading into a critical week for Democrats. Can the Democrats unite their party — and win over any Republicans? Despite the extraordinary circumstances of this year’s event, more traditional convention imperatives — energizing the party and engaging swing voters — remain, too. Monday will offer a vivid illustration of the broad coalition the Democrats are hoping to assemble. Michelle Obama, the former first lady, is the headliner, but the lineup also includes both Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s progressive primary rival, and former Gov. John Kasich, Republican of Ohio. As Mr. Biden seeks to excite skeptical liberals while reaching out to moderates disillusioned with President Trump, Monday will demonstrate how Democrats hope to thread that needle. Will the technology cooperate? When Mr. Biden held a “virtual town hall” event in March, things did not go exactly as planned . Since then, America has settled in to communicating via video, but the technology risks at the convention are real. Will the satellite feeds hold? Will prominent participants accidentally mute — or unmute — themselves? Will anyone be interrupted while recording at home by well-meaning visitors, “BBC dad” -style? The remote style of the convention, however, also brings opportunity. Speakers have been encouraged to seek out interesting locations for their backdrops. Who will claim the most iconic spot? Can the candidates create any drama? Some politicians — Mr. Biden chief among them — thrive off audience reaction. How will he and other speakers build to crescendos and electrify viewers when there is no enthralled crowd cheering them on? This past week, when Mr. Biden debuted with his running mate , Senator Kamala Harris, they had only the cameras and a group of journalists to wave to. Will any new faces emerge? Conventions offer an unmatched platform for up-and-coming politicians to leave an impression in front of a national audience — just ask Barack Obama, whose keynote address at the 2004 convention was a pivotal moment in his rapid ascent from state senator to U.S. senator to president. Even in a virtual format, there is still plenty of opportunity to get on people’s radar across the country. Who will make the most of that chance? How will Trump respond? One thing is certain: The convention will place a lot of attention on a lot of Democratic politicians who are not fond of Mr. Trump. And Mr. Trump is unlikely to be restrained in his commentary next week. One of the most powerful speeches of the 2016 Democratic convention came from Khizr Khan, the father of a Muslim American soldier who was killed while serving in Iraq. Mr. Khan denounced Mr. Trump’s campaign message, and Mr. Trump proceeded to attack Mr. Khan and his wife , igniting a political firestorm . Will a similar dynamic play out next week? Copied to clipboard. President Donald Trump during a news conference at his golf club in Bedminster, N.J., on Saturday. Credit… Erin Schaff/The New York Times President Trump on Saturday accused Democrats of refusing to fund the United States Postal Service as he faced intense criticism from Democrats who say slowdowns in mail delivery, the removal of sorting machines and other changes are threatening the integrity of the general election. Speaking at a news conference at his golf resort in Bedminster, N.J., Mr. Trump also continued to rail against mail-in voting, calling it “a catastrophe.” But he did not directly say whether he supported the removal of mail-sorting machines and other changes made under the leadership of his postmaster general, Louis DeJoy . “I don’t know what he’s doing,” Mr. Trump said. “I can only tell you he’s a very smart man. He’ll be a great Postmaster General.” Democrats have, in fact, pushed for a total of $10 billion for the Postal Service in talks with Republicans on the coronavirus response bill. That figure, which would include money to help with election mail, was down from a $25 billion plan in a House-passed coronavirus measure. Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and House Democratic leadership have begun discussing bringing the chamber back early to address the issues with the Postal Service, a move that would cut short the annual summer recess. While the House is not scheduled to return for votes until Sept. 14, Democratic leaders could call lawmakers back in the next two weeks, two people familiar with the talks said on Saturday. Among the legislative options under consideration include a measure put forward by Representative Carolyn B. Maloney of New York, the chairwoman of the House Oversight Committee, that would prohibit agency leadership from enacting any operational changes that were in place before Jan. 1 or once the public health crisis subsides. Such changes would include ending overtime pay or any measures that would delay mail. Lawmakers are also discussing adding language to the bill that would ensure all ballot-related mail is considered First Class Mail and treated as such. While Democrats have been fighting to include funding for the Postal Service in a coronavirus relief package, it is unlikely that Democrats would act on a standalone funding bill, said the two people, who asked for anonymity in order to disclose details of private discussions, because the current crisis the agency is facing is tied to policy, not funding.

Credit… Eric Baradat/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images President Trump will travel to the battleground state of Pennsylvania on Thursday to deliver remarks attacking Joseph R. Biden Jr. just a few miles from the former vice president’s childhood home, a few hours before Mr. Biden is scheduled to take the stage at the Democratic National Convention. The Trump campaign said Saturday that Mr. Trump will discuss “Joe Biden’s record of failure” in remarks he will deliver in Old Forge, Pa., roughly six miles southwest of Scranton, Pa., where Mr. Biden grew up. He will offer his comments around 3 p.m. on Thursday, the campaign said. A spokesman for Mr. Biden on Saturday called Mr. Trump’s event a “sideshow” and “a pathetic attempt to distract from the fact that Trump’s presidency stands for nothing but crises, lies and division.” Mr. Biden is scheduled to accept the Democratic nomination on the last day of the party’s online convention and deliver his own speech Thursday night around 10 p.m. Mr. Trump’s planned stop in Pennsylvania on Thursday will cap a week in which he is scheduled to swing through Minnesota, Wisconsin and Arizona — all states that could also be potentially up for grabs in the fall — and attack Mr. Biden on the economy and immigration during a key week for Democrats. Vice President Mike Pence is also scheduled to travel to Wisconsin on Wednesday, where the Trump campaign said he will criticize Mr. Biden over his record on taxes and trade. In addition to featuring remarks by Mr. Biden and his running mate, Senator Kamala Harris of California, the Democratic National Convention will feature prime-time keynote speeches by Michelle Obama on Monday, Jill Biden on Tuesday and Barack Obama on Wednesday.

Credit… Erin Schaff/The New York Times The Trump campaign is launching an aggressive four-day digital advertising campaign that will take over some of the internet’s most conspicuous real estate during the three marquee days of the Democratic National Convention — a nearly all-digital event. Adhering to the president’s penchant for focusing attention on himself during major Democratic events, the Trump campaign will be taking over the banner of YouTube for 96 hours starting on Tuesday, the second day of the convention, an expensive and far-reaching digital gambit. The campaign will also blanket the home pages of The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post and FoxNews.com with Trump campaign ads. Even non-convention programming will be inundated with Trump ads, as the campaign has bought premium, or “unskippable,” ads on sites like Hulu. The campaign amounts to “high-seven figures,” a significant sum to spend online in such a short period of time, and could top $10 million (a few digital ads are sometimes charged extra based on engagement). The takeover of the YouTube banner and the news sites’ home pages are national buys, while the spending for Hulu and others will be in swing states. Trump campaign officials said they were able to grab the digital slots because the Democrats, who moved their original convention date, had not purchased the time for the original week in July, nor for the new one beginning on Monday.

WOULD BE THE TWO INDICATORS THAT WE HAVE TO LOOK AT WE KEEP TALKING ABOUT 360 HOW GREAT THINGS ARE GOING. WHICH YOU KNOW THINGS HAVE GONE. WELL, IT’S BEEN GOOD THINGS, BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS THERE’S A TIE HOW HEALTHY ON THE HIGH IS NUMBER ONE HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE INCARCERATED IS A NUMBER GOING UP OR GOING DOWN NUMBER TWO HOW MANY CHILDREN ARE LIVING BELOW THE POVERTY LINE GOING UP GOING DOWN A WHAT ARE THE RACIAL DISPARITIES IN THOSE CATEGORIES AND THE ONLY WAY TO ACCOMPLISH THE CHANGES THAT ARE NECESSA TO IMPACT THE POVERTY IN NORTH OMAHA IS OPERATIONS PLAN WIT MASSIVE INFUSION OF RESOURCES THE KIND OF THINGS THAT WILLIE BARNEY’S INVEST A LOT OF TIME IN THE REST OF COMMUNITIES BUILD A LOT OF TIME IN THEY JUST NEED TO BE AMPED UP ABOUT 510 TIMES AND I’VE BEEN LOOKING AT WAYS THAT THE FAITH COMMUNITIES OUT WEST OMAHA CAN START STEPPING UP. WE’RE NOT TALKING ABOUT WRITING CHECKS AND HANDING THEM OUT TO PEOPLE ARE WE? I THINK WHAT YOU SAW HAPPENING IN, NORTH CAROLINA, I THINK ALONG THOSE LINES ARE SOME THINGS THAT C HAPPEN HERE IN OMAHA AND IN NEBRASKA ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE CAN DO IF WE WERE REALLY GOING TO ADDRESS AND GET AT THE STRUCTURAL NATURE OF RACISM NUMBER ONE IS THE RESOLUTION THAT COUNC COMMISSIONER ROGERS, AND I JOINTLY INTRODUCED TO BOTH THE CITY COUNCIL AND THE COUNTY BOARD ASKING TO ELIMINATE THE BAN O AFFIRMATIVE ACTION THAT CURRENTLY EXISTS IN THE STA CONSTITUTION. IT HAS NO BUSINESS THERE. THE LANGUAGE THAT WAS USED TO GET PEOPLE TO BUY INTO THAT WAS FALSE AND PHONY AND SO IT NEEDS TO BE OUT OF THERE IF WE’RE GOING TO REALLY GET AT THE STRUCTURAL NATURE OF RACISM AND BEGIN TO ADDRESS IT. IN TERMS OF REPARATIONS, I THINK WITH NORTH CAROLINA IS DOING IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION WHEN WE’RE TALKING ABOUT REPARATIONS, AND I’M JUST GOING TO TALK ABOU ME FOR A MINUTE, YOU KNOW WHEN I THINK ABOUT REPARATIONS, YOU KNOW, MY QUESTION IS ALWAYS I DON’T KNOW THAT YOU HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO DO WHAT H HAPPENED TO US OVER 450 YEARS. UM WHAT HAPPENED TO OUR CULTURE WHAT HAPPENED TO OUR LANGUAGE WH HAPPENED TO OUR RELIGION? WE WEREN’T WE WEREN’T AT WHEN? CAME WHEN WE WERE BROUGHT WHEN OUR ANCESTORS WERE BROUGHT HERE, YOU KNOW, I DON’T KNOW THAT WE WOULD CHRISTIAN. I DON’T KNOW THAT WE WOULD YOU I DON’T KNOW WHAT WE WERE, YOU KNOW, BECAUSE ALL THE THAT CULTURE HAS BEEN LOST. AND WHAT’S GOING TO BE THE PRICE TAG FOR THAT TO ME? I DON’T KNOW THAT THERE WAS ENOUGH MONEY TO ADDRESS THE LOSS OF OUR CULTURE FOR OVER 400 YEARS. AMY WATKINS IS FINAL QUESTION IS FOR YOU WITH INCLUSIVE COMMUNITIES WITH THE PROTESTS IN THIS SORT OF NEW AWAKENING. I’M SEEING SOME AWKWARD EXCHANGES ON SOCIAL MEDIA WHITE PEOPLE APOLOGIZING TO THEIR BLACK FRIENDS. IS IT APPROPRIATE AND IS IT NECESSARY TO APOLOGIZE? YOU KNOW, I DON’T WANT TO POLICE PEOPLE’S CHOICES OF HOW THEY’RE ADDRESSING ISSUES, BUT I THINK THAT WE TALK A LOT ABOUT APOLOGY AND I LOVE THAT PAULA BROUGHT UP BRIAN SEE LISTEN, HE HAS A QUOTE OUT THAT SAYS THAT TRUTH AND RECONCILIATION ARE SEQUENTIAL AND YOU CAN’T HAVE RECONCILIATION WITHOUT TRUTH. SO IF WE’RE NOT WILLING TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE TRUTH O OUR HISTORY AND CURRENT RACIAL INEQUITIES THAT EXIST W CAN’T JUMP TO ACCEPT RECONCILIATION I THINK TOO OFTEN PEOPLE WANT TO CELEBRATE OUR WAY OUT OF PAIN. WE WANT TO YOU DON’T YOU CAN’T FIX PAIN WITH BIRTHDAY CAKE SO CONSTANTLY LOOKING AT HOW ARE WE JUST JUMPING TO OKAY, WE’RE GOOD AND LET’S MOVE PAST THIS AND IGNORE THAT’S NOT GOING TO WORK. SO WE DO NEED THE ACKNOWLEDGEMENT THE ATONEMENT AND THEN FIGURE OUT NOW. LET’S STEP TO THOSE POLICIES THAT ARE GOING TO INSTITUTIONALIZE THE BEHAVIORS BECAUSE IF WE’RE NOT FIGURING OUT AND GETTING BEYOND THE IDEA THAT JUST ONE PERSON’S CHANGED RECKONING IS GOING TO CHANGE THE SYSTEM. WE’RE NEVER GOING TO BREAK THESE CYCLES. WE HAVE TO STOP JUST FIXING THE FISH IN THE IDEAS OF THE GROUNDWATER APPROACH, BUT WE NEED TO START FIXING THE CONTAMINATED LAKE AND LOOKING AT THOSE PIECES OF THAT ARE THE ROOT OF THE PROBLEM THAT WE ALL KNOW WHAT THEY ARE. WE HAVE PLENTY OF RESEARCH AND DATA THAT SHOWS IT. SO THE APOLOGY IS GREAT, BUT IF IT’S NOT FOLLOWED BY ACTION TO ACTUALLY CHANGE SOMETHING, IT’S MUTE. I AGREE WITH KAMI AND WHAT COUNCILMAN GRAY ACTION SPEAKS LOUDER THAN WORDS ONE THING I HAVE LEARNED SINCE THIS WITH WHAT DOES BEING IN IS PANDEMIC AND WHAT EVERYTHING AS WELL AS WITH THE PROTEST. WE HAVE A LOT OF OUR WHITE ALLIES WHO ARE ARE REALLY STRONG SAY OH, HOW CAN I HELP? HOW CAN I HELP AND MY THING IS THAT WE WANT YOU TO HELP WE WANT YOU TO BE THERE. WE WANT YOU TO SUPPORT US, BUT YO CANNOT LEAVE THE CONVERSATION THIS THIS RIGHT NOW WHAT’S GOING ON IS IT HAS TO BE LED BY PEOPLE OF COLOR AND AFRICAN AMERICANS WHO ARE BEING IMPACTED EVERY DAY. JUST THE OTHER DAY. I HAD A CONVERSATION WITH SOMEONE SAID WELL, WHY DO YOU HAVE IT? WHY DOES YOUR SHIRT SAY BLACK LIVES MATTER? WHY DOESN’T ALL LIVES MATTER AND IT’S WHAT I EXPLAINED TO THEM. SAID RIGHT NOW, I UNDERSTAND AND I HAVE SUPPORT THE POLICE I SUPPORT A LIVES, BUT RIGHT NOW BLACK LIVES ARE IN THE FOREFRONT OF BEING TAKEN EVERY DAY. SO RIGHT NOW MY STANCE IN MY MY MY POT WHAT I’M WHAT I’M FIGHTING FOR RIGHT NOW. IT’S FOR BLACK LIVES NOT TO SAY THAT IF YOU IF I SEE SOMEONE WHO DOESN’T LOOK LIKE ME BEING HURT TH NOT GOING TO STEP IN AND TRY THAT HELP THEM I WILL BUT RIGHT NOW WE NEED TO BE FOCUSED ON WHAT’S AT MOST AT HAND. IS THAT RIGHT? NOW? WE ARE BEING IMPACTED LIKE I SAID AGAIN, I LOVE MY WHITE ALLIES. JUST REMEMBER WE HAVE TO HOLD THE CONVERT HAVE THAT LEAD THE CONVERSATION AND YOU ARE MORE THAN WELCOME TO STAND THERE WITH US AND SUPPORT US ALL THE WAY THROUGH. WE HAVE TO NOT BYPASS THE RECONCILIATION PART WHEN WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THERE’S A CONVERSATION OF HOW TO SOUTH AFRICA MOVE FORWARD IN THEIR RACIAL WORK IN A PART-TIME AND THINGS LIKE THAT BECAUSE THE TRUTH WAS THERE AND THE PEOPLE OWNED UP TO THAT TRUTH AND TALKED ABOUT THAT TRUTH ACCEPTED THAT TRUTH AND SAID NOW, HOW DO WE MOVE FORWARD SO WE HAVE TO HAVE THAT RECONCILIATION PART BEFORE WE CAN EVEN BEGIN THE CONVERSATION AROUND REPARATIONS, AND THAT’S TRUE TO WHAT COUNCIL MEMBER WRAITH IT. IT’S HOW DO WE EVEN HAVE ENOUGH TO TO? GAME OVER BECAUSE HOW ARE YOU GOING TO SPLIT IT OUT? YOU HAVE NORTH CAROLINA WHO’S GOING TO TAKE THE TOWN AND COMMERCIAL. I KNOW WHO’S GOING TO FOCUS ON THERE THEN WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE IN OMAHA THEN WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE IN LA? WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO? BECAUSE IF SOMEBODY IS GOING TO GET THE SHORT END OF THE STICK AND THE REPARATIONS ARE NOT GOING TO BE THE SAME. SO IT’S LIKE DOOU EVEN HAVE THE CAPACITY TO GET AROUND THAT AND WHAT TO PRECIOUS POINT? WE HAVE TO CENTER THE VOICES OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE IMPACTED BY WHAT IS GOING ON. HAVE TO TAKE THESE INVESTMENTS NOW TO ANOTHER SCALE TO REALLY ADDRESS THESE ISSUES. WE’VE SEEN PROGRESS AND GOING FROM 31 PERCENT POVERTY RATE DOWN TO 22% BUT 22% IS STILL TOO HIGH. WE’VE SEEN UNEMPLOYMENT FOR AFRICAN-AMERICANS GO FROM 21 PERCENT TO 7 PERCENT, BUT SEVEN PERCENT IS STILL TOO HIGH AND NOW WOULD COVID IT’S BEEN EXPANDED EVEN MORE SO WE KNOW AND THE AREAS THAT WE’VE MADE INVESTMENT AND WE’VE COLLABORATED AND WE’VE ALIGNED WE KNOW THAT WE CAN TAKE THOSE THINGS TO SCALE, BUT IT’S GOING BUT IT’S GOING TO REQUIRE ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT AND EVERY ONE OF THOSE SO THE NUMBERS ARE IMPROVING, BUT IS IT ENOUGH WHEN WE COME BACK MEET A MAN? WHO’S TRYING TO CREATE A LOCAL COALITION TO ADDRESS SLAVERY AND\nAdvertisement\nCHRONICLE: The Call for Reparations\nCommunity leaders discuss the effort to even out opportunities and make up for disparities.\nShare",

Dissimilar to organizations that are modestly effective in giving treatment to deal with the ailment, which requires a lifetime of drug and normal physical treatment, Abeona has possessed the capacity to give a solitary, one-time treatment, to rectify the lacking catalyst.\nAbeona is not just getting a charge out of the clinical results to date, the organization is likewise a most loved of patient and guardian backing bunches, like those that have been applying colossal weight on the FDA to endorse a strong dystrophy drug made by Sarepta (NASDAQ:SRPT). As vital as the patient support gatherings may be, nothing can contrast with a firsthand record of the treatment and its obvious achievement, and Abeona has that also.\nAlbeit most clinical trials propel tolerant classification, patients can talk uninhibitedly about the ABO-102 results for two reasons. To begin with, Abeona is putting forth an “once and done” treatment, whereby patients are not being frequently treated by an Abeona treatment. What’s more, second, the trial is being directed by an outsider, Nationwide Children’s Hospital. Hence, financial specialists have been dealt with to some solid and convincing information on online networking that makes Abeona sparkle. ",

      "text": "Posted By: Editor\nWASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump’s push to cut Social Security payroll taxes for the rest of the year — and even arguing for a permanent cut — would do little to bolster the coronavirus-battered economy in the short term and could destabilize long-term funding for benefits that millions of Americans depend on.\nTrump this week said that he could eliminate the tax if he is reelected without undercutting the retirement program or greatly adding to the deficit, arguing that economic growth would offset the revenue losses.\n“At the end of the year, the assumption that I win, I’m going to terminate the payroll tax, which is another thing that some of the great economists would like to see done,” Trump told reporters on Wednesday, adding that “tremendous growth” in the U.S. will cover the costs of Social Security. “We’ll be paying into Social Security through the general fund.”\nBut aides to the president on Thursday sought to walk back Trump’s comments. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said Trump meant to say he would seek forgiveness of employee payroll tax payments that he had already ordered deferred for the rest of the year.\nEmployers are pressing the Trump administration to walk back even more parts of the plan. They want Treasury to make it voluntary, letting companies decide if they want to offer their workers the option of deferring payroll taxes. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce says it has “serious concerns” whether the tax deferral would be workable.\nIn comments Wednesday to reporters, Trump said at least four times that he would end the payroll tax.\nThe president added that the tax would be eliminated after the “beginning of the New Year,” while the deferral only applies to the closing months of 2020. Trump said his planned payroll tax reduction would be a “number that’s bigger than any of the numbers we talked about.” A typical family would get back $5,000 or more, Trump said, an average economists said would not be achieved. Story continues\nWhen pressed Wednesday about how the U.S. government would then pay for Social Security after the payroll tax is “permanently” rescinded, the president did not revise his previous comments. Instead, he insisted that economic growth would surge to cover the mammoth expense that would exceed $1 trillion.\nThe 12.4% payroll tax split between employers and workers funds Social Security. The tax raised roughly $1 trillion last year, according to U.S. government data. Over a 10-year period, Trump’s idea could slice $13 trillion from U.S. budget that is already laden with rising debt loads.\nIt is highly unlikely that economic growth would be enough to offset the loss of the payroll tax. Indeed, Trump suggested that his 2017 income tax cuts would propel economic growth as high as 6% annually. That never happened.\n“If you permanently roll it back, how are you going to fund Social Security?” said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton. “The numbers just don’t add up.”\nSome economists also questioned the utility of even a short-term payroll tax cut — something Trump has been pushing for months despite facing opposition among some fellow Republicans — would have on helping the economy.\nPayroll tax cuts are among the least effective ways to promote growth during a recession, said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody Analytics. The money is going to people who are working — not the unemployed — and is most likely to be saved rather than pushed back into the economy, he said.\nDeferral of the payroll tax, if it’s not forgiven at the end of the year, amounts to a four-month, interest free loan for workers who are still collecting a paycheck and could leave employers on the line to claw back money retroactively.\n“The idea that it would pay for itself through growth is just not right. It won’t,” said Zandi. “It’s just a dream.”\nEven tinkering with Social Security funding comes freighted with political risk for Trump, who as a candidate in 2016 set himself apart from much of the GOP primary field as he vowed to oppose cuts to Social Security and Medicare, while also ensuring every American had health coverage. Trump has yet to propose a health care plan.\nThursday evening, AARP sent off what amounts to a warning letter to the president, saying he needs to provide Americans with “a more complete explanation” of his plan.\n“Suspending, reducing, or eliminating the contributions to Social Security made through the payroll tax will interfere with Social Security’s long-term funding stream,” wrote Jo Ann Jenkins, CEO of the seniors’ lobby. “The American public deserves to hear your plan on how you would replace that funding, and how people can count on receiving their hard-earned Social Security benefits.”\nMcEnany, said Thursday that Trump maintains an “unwavering commitment to Social Security that is fully funded, and that seniors are taken care of.”\nBut former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, said Trump’s comments on should be a red flag about how the president would approach benefit programs in a second term.\n“When Donald Trump continually says that he wants to take action to defund Social Security…we should take him literally and seriously,” said Biden spokesman TJ Ducklo.\nWhether or not voters will punish Trump for his Social Security gambit, the president’s idea seems an unlikely fix for the long-term financial shortfall the program faces. When Social Security’s reserves are exhausted in 2035, the program will only be able to pay 79% of benefits at that time, according to government estimates.\n“Everybody uses and abuses Social Security in the political discourse,” said Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee For A Responsible Federal Budget, which advocates for lowering the federal deficit. “What we should be doing is fixing the imbalance in the trust fund.”\n“What the president is suggesting would make the finances worse,” she added.\n—-\nAssociated Press writer Bill Barrow in Atlanta contributed reporting.

      "text": " Remarkable Stocks in Focus: Calpine Corporation (NYSE:CPN), Cliffs Natural Resources Inc (NYSE:CLF), XenoPort, Inc. (NASDAQ:XNPT) Remarkable Stocks in Focus: Calpine Corporation (NYSE:CPN), Cliffs Natural Resources Inc (NYSE:CLF), XenoPort, Inc. (NASDAQ:XNPT) , Uncategorized Comments Off on Remarkable Stocks in Focus: Calpine Corporation (NYSE:CPN), Cliffs Natural Resources Inc (NYSE:CLF), XenoPort, Inc. (NASDAQ:XNPT)\nOn Monday, Shares of Calpine Corporation (NYSE:CPN), lost -0.64% to $15.41.\nCalpine Corporation, stated third quarter 2015 Adjusted EBITDA of $791 million, contrast to $745 million in the preceding year period, and Adjusted Free Cash Flow of $576 million, or $1.61 per diluted share, contrast to $506 million, or $1.26 per diluted share, in the preceding year period. Net Income1 for the third quarter of 2015 was $273 million, or $0.76 per diluted share, contrast to $614 million, or $1.52 per diluted share, in the preceding year period. Net Income, As Adjusted2, for the third quarter of 2015 was $347 million contrast to $306 million in the preceding year period. The improvements in Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Free Cash Flow and Net Income, As Adjusted,were primarily due to higher Commodity Margin driven by the acquisition of our Fore River Energy Center in November 2014 and the commencement of operations at our Garrison Energy Center in June 2015, in addition to higher regulatory capacity revenue in PJM.\nYear-to-date 2015 Adjusted EBITDA was $1,586 million, contrast to $1,604 million in the preceding year period, and Adjusted Free Cash Flow was $745 million, or $2.02 per diluted share, contrast to $735 million, or $1.77 per diluted share, in the preceding year period. Net Income1 for the first nine months of 2015 was $282 million, or $0.77 per diluted share, contrast to $736 million, or $1.77 per diluted share, in the preceding year period. Net Income, As Adjusted2, for the first nine months of 2015 was $318 million contrast to $359 million in the preceding year period. The decreases in Adjusted EBITDA and Net Income, As Adjusted, were primarily due to lower Commodity Margin driven largely by a noteworthy decrease in power and natural gas prices in our East region in the first quarter of 2015, given the unusually high price levels practiced during the polar vortex events in the preceding year period, in addition to net portfolio changes and lower regulatory capacity revenue in PJM. The improvement in Adjusted Free Cash Flow was due to lower interest expense contrast to the preceding year period, which more than offset the decline in Adjusted EBITDA.\n“I am happy to report another solid quarter, with record generation volume of 33 million MWh, top quartile safety performance and continued commercial success,” said Thad Hill, Calpine’s President and Chief Executive Officer. “As a result, we are narrowing our 2015 Adjusted EBITDA guidance to a range of $1.965 billion to $2.0 billion. This is within our preceding guidance range and reflects an adjustment for the projected impact of the Valley wildfire in Northern California on The Geysers geothermal facilities, which we formerly declared. I would like to recognize our team at The Geysers whose extraordinary efforts have resulted in production already reaching about 575 net MW, or nearly 80% of full capacity.\nCalpine Corporation, a wholesale power generation company, owns and operates natural gas-fired and geothermal power plants in North America. It operates natural gas-fired combustion turbines and renewable geothermal conventional steam turbines.\nShares of Cliffs Natural Resources Inc (NYSE:CLF), inclined 3.99% to $2.87,\nCliffs Natural Resources, stated third-quarter results for the period ended September 30, 2015. Third-quarter 2015 merged revenues of $593 million reduced 39 percent from the preceding years third-quarter revenues of $980 million. Cost of goods sold reduced by 26 percent to $538 million contrast to $724 million stated in the third quarter of 2014.\nFor the third quarter of 2015, the Company recorded net income of $6 million contrast to a net loss of $6.9 billion recorded in the preceding-year quarter. The Company recorded a net loss attributable to Cliffs common shareholders of $15 million, or $0.10 per diluted share, contrast to a net loss attributable to Cliffs common shareholders of $5.9 billion, or $38.49 per diluted share recorded in the third quarter of 2014.\nLourenco Goncalves, Cliffs Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, Our performance this past quarter illustrates how far we have come in our turnaround story. We have been able to deliver noteworthycost reductions in all areas of the business through disciplined execution of the strategy instituted last year. Mr. Goncalves added, We expect the domestic steel market to improve in 2016 as trade actions reduce the pressure of imports and firm up steel pricing. Our solid cost position coupled with stronger demand from the mills should drive better profitability for Cliffs.\nCliffs Natural Resources Inc., a mining and natural resources company, produces iron ore and metallurgical coal. It operates five iron ore mines that produces iron ore pellets in Michigan and Minnesota; Koolyanobbing complex situated in northeast of the town of Southern Cross, which produces lump and fines iron ore; and two metallurgical coal mines located in Alabama and West Virginia.\nFinally, Shares of XenoPort, Inc. (NASDAQ:XNPT), 0.65% gain, and closed at $6.15.\nXenoPort, declared that it will provide access via the World Wide Web to its presentation at the 2015 Credit Suisse Healthcare Conference in Phoenix, Arizona.

      "text": "August 16, 2020 Share\nAs the S&P 500 struggles to rise a fraction of a percentage point to be able to achieve the status of reclaiming its February all-time high level…\nImagine you could go back to February 19, 2020.\nThe S&P 500 Index and ETF (SPY) has just closed at a new all-time high, and news of the COVID-19 virus causing havoc in China is in the headlines, but this time…\nYou know that a pandemic will soon cripple the U.S. economy and crash the stock market from its peak to down over 30% faster than any other time in history.\nYou also know the market will recover quicker than anyone expects led by technology companies that will find a silver lining in the chaos and provide the same for their shareholders.\nKnowing that sliver of the future, you’re forced to answer this question…\nWhich ETF will make you the best return from then (February 19 th ) to now, the time when the SPY returns to its February levels?\nYou must choose between XRT or QQQ.\nFirst, I have to give a big “thank you” to Stock Charts, which made it so easy for me to provide you with these charts.\nNote, I added the tickers to the chart’s bars to make it quicker to read.\nAs you can see from the charts below, the Retail Sector (XRT) has some real fight in her!\nI’d call it a tie.\nHere’s a different view of the same group of symbols over the same time frame so you can see their journey.\nNow let’s do the same exercise, but starting from the March 23 rd low in the SPY…\nThe low was created by the Fed’s announcement that it will do whatever it takes to stabilize the bond markets, including buying corporate bonds at every grade (all way down to Junk!).\nFrom the chart above, you already know XRT has kept up with the QQQ, and crushed the SPY since February.\nAnd you know that since February the Regional Banks (KRE) have been the worst performer.\nThat said…\nWhich ETF will do better from the lows, bonds (TLT) or the banks (KRE)?\nThe answer is below…\nI’ll leave the analysis and the “why?” up to you, so as not to cloud this simple message, which is also the theme of this week’s Market Outlook…\nIf you want to follow the market, sometimes you need to remember not to let what logic get in the way of reality.\nAs traders, we have several ways of saying this. For example…\nTrade what you see, not what you think.\nHere’s a look at how the same group of symbols from above have moved since the S&P 500’s March 23 low. Note the color of the lines and bars are not the same in these charts as the ones above.\nHere’s the same data with an easier way to see the end result.\nDid you answer the questions correctly?\nIf you’d like to make your own charts like these, here’s a link to this list of symbols in the StockCharts’ default view and time frame (200 days). You can change the time frame by clicking on the slider’s number of days at the bottom right and the chart type with the icons at the bottom left.\nLet me know what you think of all this in comments section below.\nS&P 500 (SPY) Double Doji pattern within Wednesday’s range. Be cautious under 332. Watch 330 as important support\nRussell 2000 (IWM) Double inside day pattern broke the pattern low and recovered. Key level to break above is 158, the160 is resistance area and 153 key support.\nDow (DIA) Third consolidation day. 270 now pivotal support\nNasdaq (QQQ) Consolidation day sitting on the 10 DMA. 275 is the all-time high level to break. 260 is key support level and a trendline.\nTLT (iShares 20+ Year Treasuries) Weak day new closing low, and closed at the low of the day. 162 next big support.\nTwitter: @marketminute\nThe author may have a position in the mentioned securities at the time of publication. author, ",

      "text": " Up to Date Stocks News Analysis: Host Hotels and Resorts Inc (NYSE:HST), Eli Lilly and Co (NYSE:LLY), Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) Up to Date Stocks News Analysis: Host Hotels and Resorts Inc (NYSE:HST), Eli Lilly and Co (NYSE:LLY), Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) Comments Off on Up to Date Stocks News Analysis: Host Hotels and Resorts Inc (NYSE:HST), Eli Lilly and Co (NYSE:LLY), Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT)\nOn Monday, Shares of Host Hotels and Resorts Inc (NYSE:HST), gained 1.56% to $17.60.\nHost Hotels & Resorts, the nations largest lodging real estate investment trust (REIT), declared results of operations for the third quarter of 2015.\nWe delivered solid results in the third quarter and remain committed to our long-term planned aim of generating superior returns for our stockholders by driving excellent operating performance, refining our strategy to adapt to changes in the lodging industry, selectively divesting assets and making well-considered, value-enhancing investments for continued growth, said W. Edward Walter, President and Chief Executive Officer. Although we have already returned more than $1 billion of capital to stockholders in 2015 through stock repurchases and compriseently strong dividends, the decision to improvement our stock repurchase program by an additional $500 million this quarter underscores the Boards confidence in our plan and future prospects. We believe that repurchasing stock is the most attractive investment opportunity available to our company recently; although we remain disciplined and opportunistic, we intend to move aggressively to repurchase shares as market conditions permit.\nThird quarter 2015 results reflect the following: Comparable RevPAR on a constant dollar basis improved 2.8% for the quarter, driven by a 2.3% improvement in average room rate and a 30 basis point improvement in occupancy to 80.3%. Year-to-date, the Companys comparable RevPAR on a constant dollar basis raised 3.9%, reflecting rate growth of 3.8%, while occupancy improved to 78.6%. The RevPAR growth was negatively influenced by about 20 basis points in both the quarter and year-to-date due to the formerly revealed adoption of the 11 th Edition of the Uniform System of Accounts for the Lodging Industry (USALI). The Company anticipated the third quarters RevPAR growth would lag full year results due to difficult comparisons to preceding year when Comparable RevPAR raised 7.9%, in addition to the shifting of holidays in the third quarter 2015. Additionally, softer than predictable leisure business and international travel in August offset above forecast performance in July and September. Comparable RevPAR at the Companys domestic properties improved 2.8% for the quarter and 4.0% year-to-date. The third quarter RevPAR improvements were led by strong performances in the Boston, Los Angeles, Seattle, and San Francisco markets. RevPAR reduced 3.4% at its Washington D.C. hotels due to a decline in convention activity and 9.7% at its Houston properties due to continued weakness in the energy market. On a constant dollar basis, RevPAR at the Companys comparable international properties raised 2.2% for the third quarter and reduced 0.1% year-to-date. The year-to-date decline was primarily due to difficult comparisons for the JW Marriott Hotel Rio de Janeiro due to the FIFA World Cup that generated exceptional results in the second and third quarter of 2014, as well as renovation disruption during 2015 at the Calgary Marriott Downtown Hotel. The decline offset a strong performance in the Companys Asia-Pacific market where RevPAR raised 6.2% and 7.7% for the quarter and year-to-date, respectively. For the third quarter, on a constant dollar basis, and not taking into account the Rio de Janeiro and Calgary properties, RevPAR raised 10.2% for the remaining 10 international properties.\nHost Hotels & Resorts, Inc. is a publicly owned real estate investment trust (REIT). The firm primarily engages in the ownership and operation of hotel properties.\nShares of Eli Lilly and Co (NYSE:LLY), inclined 0.56% to $82.03, during its last trading session.\nEli Lilly and Company, revealed plans to expand its global research and development (R&D) headquarters in Indianapolis, Indiana. Adding 130,000 square feet to Lillys existing complex, the new $70 million building will feature a multi-disciplinary laboratory that facilitates partnership across multiple research functions. The new building is part of Lillys continued growth of its Indianapolis footprint, which comprised a $400 million expansion initiated in 2013 to improvement its insulin manufacturing capacity.\nWe are excited to grow our presence in Indianapolis, which is home to our largest global R&D facility and where our research efforts began, said Jan Lundberg, Ph.D., executive vice president of science and technology and president of Lilly Research Laboratories. Evolving our laboratories will position Lilly and its Indianapolis-based scientists to more efficiently discover and develop new treatments that will make life better.\nUpon completion in 2017, the new building will enable organic chemists and engineers to work side-by-side in a collaboration-centric workspace with modelling, analytical and formulation scientists. Key to this success will be flexible laboratories that can adapt as research and technology needs evolve, in addition to open, interactive meeting spaces that are meant to spark creativity and multi-disciplinary problem-solving. The laboratory will focus its efforts on small molecules – treatments typically taken orally – which presently comprise about half of Lillys investigational medicines portfolio.\nEli Lilly and Company discovers, develops, manufactures, and sells pharmaceutical products worldwide. It operates through two segments, Human Pharmaceutical Products and Animal Health Products. The company offers endocrinology products to treat diabetes; osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and men; human growth hormone deficiency and pediatric growth conditions; and testosterone deficiency.\nFinally, Shares of Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT), ended its last trade with 0.12% gain, and closed at $77.28.\nTarget Corporation, declared it will give guests a more convenient shopping experience this holiday season through new and expanded digital tools and resources, counting free shipping and returns at Target.com, and new international shipping options. Target’s holiday shoppers also will find top gifts and décor, ways to save throughout the season, and a marketing campaign, The Holiday Odyssey, that will tell the tale of a larger-than-life holiday journey.\n“Target is starting the season with momentum in our business, anchored by raised store traffic and strength in our signature categories of baby, kids, style and wellness. The work we’ve done throughout the past year puts us in a position to deliver the convenient services and differentiated product our guests count on from Target, especially during the holidays,” said Brian Cornell, Chairman of the Board and CEO, Target. “I’m confident that guests will find an easy, inspiring, and most importantly, seamless experience at Target no matter how they choose to shop.”\nTarget Corporation operates as a general merchandise retailer in the United States and Canada. It offers household essentials, counting pharmacy, beauty, personal care, baby care, cleaning, and paper products; music, movies, books, computer software, sporting goods, and toys; electronics, such as video game hardware and software; and apparel for women, men, boys, girls, toddlers, infants, and newborns, in addition to intimate apparel, jewelry, accessories, and shoes.

Six stocks account for more than 50% of the Nasdaq 100 and 23% of the S&P 500 – AAPL, FB, AMZN, GOOGL, MSFT, TSLA. All of them are looking constructively.\nIn the meantime, many momentum leaders have been under pressure. Biotech is among the worst-performing sectors for the past month. XBI is looking vulnerable to further downside pressure. If XBI loses 107.50, it might test 110. Most software stocks didn’t have a great earnings season. We saw quite a few selloffs and the usual bounces have not been very convincing: AYX, CRWD, BILL, TWLO, etc. There are more bearish setups but most of those setups have been failing and reversing higher.

      "text": "Economists are often lampooned because of their inability to forecast changes in the business cycle. But the pandemic helped them overcome the challenge this time. A record contraction in Q2 was anticipated before in March. Similarly, economists generally expected the recovery after the March-April body blow. However, after an initial surge, some high-frequency data point a deceleration of the rebound.\nThat is what is important about next week's economic reports. Businesses, investors, and policymakers get insight into how the economies are doing in the middle of Q3. For many large economies, there is a preliminary purchasing managers' survey. One could be skeptical of projecting data from the first part of the month to the entire month, but the initial estimate is fairly good, and revisions tend to be minor. Many of the regional Federal Reserve branches conduct surveys of the manufacturing sector. New York (Empire State) and the Philadelphia Fed surveys also begin the monthly cycle of high-frequency economic reports.\nThe eurozone manufacturing PMI may have continued to recover, while the service PMI may not after a recent surge that lifted it to match its best level since March 2018 (54.7). The US composite PMI in July poked back above the 50 boom/bust level (50.3) for the first time since January. If the GDP trackers are fair (Atlanta Fed 26.2% Q3 or even the NY Fed's 14.80% estimate), it would seem to point to a higher reading.\nInvestors may be particularly sensitive to weakness in August data, especially given that comments from several Fed officials seem to reflect high concerns about the economy, the stronger than expected July core retail sales and manufacturing output would suggest. Despite the disappointing manufacturing employment data (26k vs median forecast in the Bloomberg survey for 255k), the auto sector, along with residential construction, and housing activity more broadly, appear to be the sectors leading the recoveries in North America. Yet, one does not need to have a Ph.D. in economics to recognize that there will be an adverse impact from the loss of $600 a week in federal unemployment insurance for some 30 mln Americans were had been receiving it under the CARES Act.\nThe US presidential system and the current configuration has given rise to a set of circumstances that has seen fiscal support curtailed at the very same time the Federal Reserve has urged more effort. It seems to also confound political considerations that with an election around the corner, an agreement could not be struck. President Trump's executive order that re-directs $44 bln of emergency relief funds to pay for a $300 a week unemployment insurance program provided they receive $100 a week in state benefits has not been launched yet.\nEven if everyone who was getting $600 a week would get $300 a week, the impact on income and consumption will be palpable. Spending could fall by 15%-20%. However, the $100 in state benefits could exclude a million or more from the new Federal program, according to some estimates. Depending on eligibility, the funding may last 2-3 months.\nThe inability to agree to a new stimulus bill bodes ill for an agreement on the budget for the next fiscal year that begins October 1. The House has passed 10 appropriation bills and the Senate none. A continuing resolution, which extends the expenditure from the current year, is the logical step in these conditions. However, the divergence of positions is such that the odds of a government shutdown, despite the widespread economic hardship and pandemic, may be growing on the margin. As investors seek protection, volatility tends to rise. While bond and G7 currency volatility have increased this month, the VIX remains pinned in its trough just above 20.\nEurope is more likely to extend its support programs, like the job furloughs, than pullback on fiscal support like the US. The parliamentary system avoids some of the distractions of the presidential system. Europe has taken three significant steps in the last couple of months: The ECB increased the size and duration of its Pandemic Emergency Purchase Program and lent over one trillion euros at a negative rate of minus 100 bp. The EU agreed to a 750 bln euro bond issuance that would be used to loans and grants in the next few years.\nOf course, the economic historian Barry Eichengreen is undoubtedly correct when he notes that the issuance is around 5% of the marketable Treasury securities. That means that it would take them 20-years at that pace to offer a benchmark was deep and as broad as the US. The favorable outlook for the euro was in place for months before the EU's Recovery Plan. Speculators, for example, in the futures market, have been net long the euro since March. They have been building it since then. Our own narrative gave more weight to the ECB's actions than the EU. The premium Italy pays over Germany on 10-year borrowing fell by more than 100 bp since early May to return to pre-pandemic levels near 140 bp.\nAs the transmission mechanism of monetary policy began working, primed with cheap funds, the euro gained traction. One implication is that the rapid growth in the ECB's balance sheet is not euro negative any more than the modest reduction in the Fed's balance sheet is dollar support. Consider, as we have noted, that ECB's balance sheet has risen by 755 bln euros (~$914.5 bln) in the eight weeks through August 7. The Fed's balance sheet fell in six of the eight weeks through August 5, shrinking by roughly $255 bln. With last week's advance, the euro has appreciated for the past eight consecutive weeks, the longest streak since 2004.\nObviously, the euro can appreciate without having to supplant the dollar as the numeraire in the world economy. After rallying roughly 10 cents from the middle of May through late July, the euro has been in a broad range for the last couple of weeks. Momentum indicators are trending lower as the euro moves sideways between roughly $1.17 and $1.1910-$1.1915. A 12-year trendline marks the highs.\nThe euro has also appreciated against the yen. It made new highs for the year last week near JPY126.750 to surpass the halfway mark of the three-year downtrend that took the euro from JPY137.5 to JPY114.40. The euro is in a trading range against sterling and has pared its earlier gains against eastern and central European currencies since the end of June.\nThere was a relative value trade here too. Surveys suggest that asset managers were underweight European equities, and they have, in fact, underperformed. Year-to-date, the S&P 500 is up by about 4.7%, while the Dow Jones Stoxx 600 is still off nearly 10%. However, here in August, Europe is barely edging out the US.\nThe cross-currency basis swap often used to transfer liquidity from one currency to another, saw the euro trade for a premium for the first time in three months. This does not appear to be a signal or a reflection of the demand for dollars or euros. Instead, the shift to about a 25 bp premium for the euro over LIBOR appears to be the function of changes in Euribor, which is slipped below the risk-free Eonia benchmarks for the first time in 15 years. If the cross-currency basis swap is calculated using OIS (overnight index swaps), a small dollar premium remains.\nThe policy signals from Chinese officials give little reason to expect a decline in the Loan Prime Rate (one-year is at 3.85%, and the five-year is at 4.65%. The relatively high yield of China's government bonds (10-year is a little below 3%) makes them attractive, especially for fund managers underweight China compared to benchmarks.\nSWIFT will also report the yuan's share of its ubiquitous platform. As the chart here illustrates, the share of the yuan rose from 2011-2015 and has, for the past five years, moved sideways. It stood at 1.76% in June and averaged 1.80% in the H1 20 and 1.93% last year. The mere fact that it is discussed to in hundredths of a percent demonstrates its minor role. China has its own clearing and settlement platform, but it remains inconsequential from a macro vantage point, with CNY135.7 bln (~$19.4 bln) in 2019.\nThe long-arm reach of the US and the significance of access to the dollar-funding market forces Chinese banks much to their chagrin to enforce Washington's sanctions, including the latest on 11 officials from Hong Kong. The US has forced SWIFT cut access to Iranian banks, for example, and although the risk is low, that the US would sanction all Hong Kong or Chinese banks, the impact would be significant.\nChinese officials recognize that the international climate has turned more hostile. Beijing has unveiled a new slogan, \"dual circulation,\" to describe its strategy to build a stronger domestic economy while maintaining its role in global supply chains. This is still consistent with the import-substitution strategy the \"Made in China 2025\" that appears to have been toned down, and maybe even dropped altogether after provoking Washington. The \"Dual Circulation\" strategy will likely be enshrined in the new five-year plan expected to be unveiled in October.\nAfter WWII, import-substitution strategies were regarded as the orthodoxy, but required large domestic markets and caused temporal dislocations (current account deficits) and stop-go policies. The success of Japan, and then followed by the Asian Tigers, demonstrated the success of export-oriented policies. The weak currencies that such strategies require became a source of friction with the US. China's export strategy was disruptive, and its turn toward an import-substitution strategy spurs another kind of criticism. The problem is that China is both a large country and a poor country. GDP per capita is $10k. US GDP per capita is around 6.5x greater. Its sheer size makes it disruptive no matter what it does, and at that stage of development, has another country put the global good ahead of its national interests? If it had a parliamentary government, like South Korea or Japan, the challenges would be nearly as daunting.\nLastly, Turkey's central bank meets on August 20. It was forced to abandon its ill-advised currency policy and the dollar briefly traded above TRY7.40 early in the week before the central bank began raising funding rates . TRY20 bln was offered at a one-month repo auction on August 13 that generated a yield of nearly 11%. The CBRT effectively closed the one-week repo facility earlier in August that had provided funds at 8.25%. The rate may be left on hold, but it is less relevant in the current environment.\nTurkey has been the largest official buyer of gold this year (148 tons through May), but its need for liquidity has spurred it to open an auction for a three-month gold swap for lira. At $2000 an ounce, the 20 tons of gold is worth around $1.28 bln. Foreign investors continue to sell Turkish bonds and stocks ($700 mln in the week ending August 7 compared with average weekly sales this year of about $370 mln). The nearly 6.5% decline in the lira since the end of June, making it the worst-performing currency in the world, will erode investors' interest in Turkish banks. The depreciation erodes capitalization ratios, and aggravate foreign liabilities. The banks have been marshaled to do the government's bidding, and it leaves them with limited, genuinely safe, and liquid assets.\nOpinions expressed are solely of the author’s, based on current market conditions, and are subject to change without notice.

Lim, was accused of instigating a Hin Leong employee to forge a document supposedly issued by UT Singapore Services Pte Ltd stating that Hin Leong had transferred more than one million barrels of gasoil to China Aviation Oil (Singapore) Corp CNAO.SI , the Singapore Police Force said in a statement on its website.\nThe document was then allegedly used to secure more than $56 million in trade financing from a financial institution, it added. It did not say when the alleged offence took place.\nIf convicted, Lim faces a jail term of up to 10 years and a fine. The police added that investigations are ongoing into other offences allegedly committed by Lim.\nLim could not immediately be reached by Reuters for comment. The Lim family's legal advisors, Davinder Singh Chambers LLC, did not immediately respond to emailed requests for comment.\nLim admitted in a court document filed earlier this year to directing the firm not to disclose hundreds of millions of dollars in losses over several years.\nHin Leong is owned by Lim, who is in his 70s, his son Lim Chee Meng, who is also known as Evan Lim, and daughter Lim Huey Ching.\nUT Singapore Services Pte Ltd, which is owned by oil storage provider Universal Terminal, did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.\nThe Attorney General Chambers did not immediately respond to emailed requests for comment. CAO declined to comment.\n(Reporting by Jessica Jaganathan Additional reporting by Roslan Khasawneh, Chen Aizhu, Seng Li Peng and Koustav Samanta Editing by Florence Tan and Frances Kerry)\n(( ; +65 6870 3822; Reuters Messaging: jessica.jaganathan.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net ; Twitter: https://twitter.com/j3ssi3 )) The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.

      "text": "Home NYSE Stocks Trending Stocks: The Procter & Gamble Company, (NYSE:PG), Tiffany & Co., (NYSE:TIF), TrueCar, (NASDAQ:TRUE) Trending Stocks: The Procter & Gamble Company, (NYSE:PG), Tiffany& Co., (NYSE:TIF), TrueCar, (NASDAQ:TRUE) August 16, 2020 Travis Garlick NYSE Stocks , Uncategorized Comments Off on Trending Stocks: The Procter & Gamble Company, (NYSE:PG), Tiffany & Co., (NYSE:TIF), TrueCar, (NASDAQ:TRUE)\nOn Monday, Shares of The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), gained 0.20% to $75.97.\nThe Procter & Gamble Company According to recent studies, most guys take about 170 strokes every time they shave, and 120 of them are re-strokes over the same area of the face after the initial strokes have wiped away most of the protective shave gel. Despite all of the advances in blade technology, many guys still experience some irritation, largely due to these re-strokes. Instead of expecting guys to change how they shave, Gillette® [NYSE:PG] has made its best cartridge even better with a product planned to reach North American store shelves in late December with more global availability in January. The new Gillette Fusion® ProShield™ with lubrication before and after the blades shields against irritation during every shave – no matter how many shave strokes he takes.\nGuys have many grooming habits that they use to look their best. But guys are often in auto-pilot mode when doing these things and other typical activities throughout the day. Some auto-pilot behaviors for guys may comprise puffing up their chest when feeling provoked, stroking their facial hair when thinking, sucking in their gut when seeing an attractive person and taking a surprising number of strokes every time they shave.\nWhen it comes to shaving on auto-pilot, guys often re-stroke over the same area without knowing it, wiping away the shave gel and ongoing the shave without the needed protection. However, shaving over the same spot without lubrication can cause skin irritation, redness and bumps that keep guys from looking and feeling their best. That’s why Gillette developed Fusion ProShield, engineered to proactively shield against irritation, with a new ProShield Lubrication Bar before the blades in addition to the Lubrastrip after the blades, while still delivering incredible closeness.\nThe Procter & Gamble Company, together with its auxiliaries, manufactures and sells branded consumer packaged products worldwide. It operates through five segments: Beauty, Hair and Personal Care; Grooming; Health Care; Fabric Care and Home Care; and Baby, Feminine and Family Care.\nShares of Tiffany & Co. (NYSE:TIF), inclined 1.88% to $76.55, during its last trading session.\nTiffany & Co., stated its financial results for the three months (“third quarter”) ended October 31, 2015. On a constant-exchange-rate basis that excludes the effect of translating foreign-currency-denominated sales into U.S. dollars (see “Non-GAAP Measures” plan), worldwide net sales rose 4%; on a stated basis, worldwide net sales were 2% below the prior year. Net earnings declined 8% (not taking into account a prior-year charge noted below) partly reflecting the negative effects from the strong U.S. dollar. Administration is now projecting net earnings for the year ending January 31, 2016 to be 5%-10% below last year’s $4.20 per diluted share (not taking into account charges in both years), and is also now projecting free cash flow in excess of $500 million for the year.\nIn the third quarter: Worldwide net sales on a constant-exchange-rate basis rose 4% and comparable store sales raised 1% due to growth in Japan, Europe and Asia-Pacific partly offset by lower sales in the Americas. Sales growth was led by higher sales of fashion gold jewelry and statement jewelry. Stated in U.S. dollars, worldwide net sales were $938 million, as contrast to $960 million a year ago. Net earnings were $91 million, or $0.70 per diluted share, contrast with $99 million, or $0.76 per diluted share, when not taking into account a pre-tax charge of $94 million, or $61 million and $0.47 per diluted share after-tax, on the extinguishment of debt related to prepaying $400 million of long-term debt (see “Non-GAAP Measures”); and the year-over-year decline reflected the lower sales and higher selling, general and administrative expenses partly offset by a higher gross margin. On a stated basis, which comprised that charge, net earnings in last year’s third quarter were $38 million, or $0.29 per diluted share.\nTiffany & Co., through its auxiliaries, designs, manufactures, and retails jewelry worldwide. Its jewelry products comprise fine and solitaire jewelry; engagement rings and wedding bands to brides and grooms; and non-gemstone, sterling silver, gold, and metal jewelry.\nFinally, Shares of TrueCar, Inc. (NASDAQ:TRUE), ended its last trade with 6.75% gain, and closed at $7.91.\nTrueCar declared that Chip Perry, an online automotive pioneer and long-time industry leader, will become the company’s president and chief executive officer, effective December 15.\nPerry was the first employee of AutoTrader.com in 1997 and served as its CEO from the company’s inception until 2013. While at the helm he guided the company’s evolution from a one-person startup into the world’s largest online automotive marketplace, with $1.5 billion in revenue, 20,000 dealer customers, 16 million monthly unique visitors and 3,500 employees. Perry oversaw AutoTrader’s creation of an array of transformative digital solutions that have assisted thousands of dealers grow their presence online. Most recently, he has been president and CEO of Atlanta-based RentPath LLC, parent company of ApartmentGuide.com and Rent.com.\n“I’ve followed TrueCar’s progress for many years and am truly excited to be joining the company. TrueCar has built incredible tools for car buyers and retailers and has a strong base on which to grow,” Perry said. “My initial focus will be on TrueCar’s dealer partners – listening to them and finding ways to serve them better.”\nTrueCar, Inc. operates as an Internet-based information, technology, and communication services company. The company operates its platform on the TrueCar Website and TrueCar mobile applications.

      "text": "Posted By: Editor Trump campaign senior adviser Jason Miller on Sunday dismissed questions about the eligibility of Harris to run for vice president, pushing back against a false racist conspiracy theory promoted by another Trump campaign adviser and echoed by the president himself. “In our opinion, it’s case closed,” Miller said in an interview on ABC News’s “This Week.” When asked about statements last week by Jenna Ellis , a senior legal adviser to the Trump campaign, promoting the conspiracy theory, Miller replied, “She wasn’t speaking for the campaign. I am.” White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows also said Sunday that he believes Harris is eligible to be vice president. “Sure,” Meadows said on CNN’s “State of the Union” when asked about Harris’s eligibility. “And I think the president spoke to this yesterday. This is not something that we’re going to pursue.” Host Jake Tapper pressed Meadows. “So, when you say ‘sure,’ that means yes? Yes, you accept that she is eligible to be vice president?” “Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes,” Meadows replied. “I do, yes.” Others in Trump’s orbit, however, did not go that far. Trump campaign adviser Steve Cortes was repeatedly asked by Fox News Channel’s Chris Wallace on Sunday whether the campaign would acknowledge that Harris is eligible to be vice president. Cortes declined to do so. “Look, again, I don’t know why it’s incumbent upon him to opine on legal scholarship of the Constitution and the 14th Amendment, for example,” Cortes said on “Fox News Sunday.”“I don’t think that’s his place as president. What he is saying is we have not made an issue of this. We will not make an issue of this.” Harris was born in Oakland, Calif., and is, by the laws of the Constitution, a U.S. citizen. But some birther conspiracy theorists say, wrongly, that her parents’ immigration status at the time of her birth makes her ineligible, and Biden’s campaign has denounced such claims as “abhorrent.” Trump — who previously promoted the past false allegation that Barack Obama was born in Kenya rather than in Hawaii and thus ineligible to serve as president — said last week that questions raised about Harris’s eligibility to run for vice president were “very serious.” “ So I just heard that, I heard it today, that she doesn’t meet the requirements,” Trump said Friday. “I have no idea if that’s right. I would have assumed the Democrats would have checked it before she gets chosen to run for vice president. But that’s a very serious … You’re saying that they’re saying that she doesn’t qualify because she wasn’t born in this country?” On Saturday, Trump repeatedly declined to say whether he believes Harris is eligible to be vice president, telling reporters that “it’s not something that I’m going to be pursuing.” “To me, it doesn’t bother me at all,” he said in Bedminster, N.J. “I don’t know about it. I read one quick article. The lawyer happens to be a brilliant lawyer, as you probably know. He wrote an article saying there could be a problem.” In his interview with Cortes on Sunday, Wallace noted that Trump “didn’t strike down” the false claim that Harris is ineligible. Trump’s campaign began promoting the conspiracy theory last week when Ellis retweeted a Newsweek op-ed written by John C. Eastman, a law professor at Chapman University in California and a senior fellow at the Claremont Institute, a conservative think tank. In his piece, Eastman questioned whether Harris’s parents were U.S. citizens at the time of her birth or “merely temporary visitors,” adding that it was possible that Harris “was not subject to the complete jurisdiction of the United States at birth, but instead owed her allegiance to a foreign power or powers.” Eastman in 2010 ran unsuccessfully for the GOP nomination for California attorney general; Harris defeated the eventual GOP nominee in the general election. The op-ed prompted a swift online backlash, and Newsweek responded by posting an editor’s note arguing that the essay “has no connection whatsoever to so-called ‘birther-ism.’” Asked last week about her decision to retweet the piece, Ellis defended Eastman’s views. “It’s an open question, and one I think Harris should answer so the American people know for sure she is eligible,” Ellis said in an email.

      "text": "Print Article\nEarlier this month, Millionaires for Humanity , a group comprising 83 of the world’s richest people, called on governments to increase their taxes in the wake of COVID’s economic fallout.\nThe idea is promising, but to be truly successful, it must be implemented in such a way that gains broad support from the rich. Otherwise, it will simply incentivize them to take their capital — and their residency — elsewhere.\nWealth taxes — where the rich are taxed on the assets they own rather than their earnings — represent one of the most popular new policy ideas in the last year. American senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders both suggested the idea in their respective campaigns for the 2020 Democratic Party primary.\nIn the U.K., the opposition Labour party has made a wealth tax one of its flagship policies, with public debt reaching record-breaking levels due to COVID-19 relief schemes. Risk of Capital Flight\nDespite strong arguments and some high-profile advocates for wealth taxes, many countries have, in fact, moved away from them recently. In 1990, 12 OECD countries had a wealth tax. By 2018, it was intact in only three countries.\nThis is, in part, explained by poor economic returns from wealth taxes. French economist Eric Pichet estimated that France lost double the actual revenues gained from its version of the wealth tax due to capital flight — it was abolished in 2017. It seems that the only effective wealth tax is a wealth tax “by consent.” Source: OECD Not an Attack on Capitalism\nLeft-wing support for wealth taxes can create the impression that they are an attack on capitalism. But smart wealth taxes can preserve capitalism in its most sustainable and meritocratic forms by increasing innovation, entrepreneurship and wealth creation, rather than simply wealth preservation.\nAlthough a wealth tax appears to be a “new” policy idea, it is, in fact, a traditional — and some would say intuitive — form of taxation. The ancient Greeks levied the eisphora wealth tax on the richest Athenians, particularly during times of war. Given that the pandemic and the response to it has been likened to a war by many leaders, perhaps there is readiness for a modern day, post-COVID “eisphora.”\nMore recently than the ancient Greeks, Zakat alms functioned as a 2.5% wealth tax on liquid assets throughout Islamic history and are a key part of the aim of Islamic economies to facilitate free trade while limiting inequality. This model has been replicated in non-governmental form by organizations like the National Zakat Foundation in the U.K. and the Zakat Foundation of America.\nBy combining the specific and short-term features of Eisphora and Zakat, we can craft wealth taxes that the richest as well as the poorest benefit from. Tax on Cash Only Would Free Trapped Wealth\nRather than taxing all assets, a tax on liquid assets only (e.g., cash or very liquid cash-like instruments) above a certain threshold would mean that the wealthy are not being penalized for their assets per se, but rather are being encouraged to circulate trapped wealth. Such a wealth tax would effectively be punishing the risk-averse and rewarding the enterprising who are willing to invest that money into the real economy to the benefit of all.\nThere is $80 trillion in “broad money” (i.e., cash or very liquid cash-like form) in the world. Currently much of this is effectively untaxed. If there were a levy of, say, 2% on this, that would raise $1.6 trillion a year. To give you an idea of how transformational that would be, it could cost as little as $7 billion to eliminate world hunger.\nBut the real benefit of a wealth tax that focuses on cash and liquid assets is not in the money it raises for governments, but in the money it circulates for the economy.\nFor example, if someone has 2 million pounds in cash and doesn’t invest it, the government will raise 40,000 pounds on a 2% tax. But if that same person wants to avoid the tax, a full 2 million pounds could well end up circulating in the economy instead — an outcome that is 50 times better than 40,000 pounds.\nThis benefit could be even more significant if governments incentivize investments in particular areas where they can deliver the most change.\nFor example, investing in venture capital will be more important than ever as this type of entrepreneurship is particularly suited to addressing societal problems and leading innovation in areas that need long-term patient capital — like biotech, infrastructure, climate change and edtech. Addressing Societal Problems\nThis increased investment can also help social mobility and social cohesion by widening access to funding for excluded groups, e.g., only 3% of financed startups in the U.K. have a Muslim founder.\nAssuming that the wealthy affected by this tax can find a mildly profitable investment for their cash, they will end up net winners compared to the status quo. Governments will need to provide low-risk, medium-return investments like green bonds or Sukuk that can make the transition to a wealth tax economy painless and profitable for the rich. Choice of Being Taxed or Invest\nIf given the choice to be taxed or to invest and circulate their wealth, many of the wealthy will choose the latter. And if this is recast as a socially responsible or even philanthropic thing to do with one’s wealth, they will feel good about it for more than one reason.\n“Sharing the wealth” doesn’t only mean giving it away to charity — it can also mean investing it so that the benefits of growth can be enjoyed by all. And smart, workable wealth taxes can make that happen at a time when the world needs to search for new solutions.\nThis article was first published on the World Economic Forum’s Agenda blog .",

      "title": "Israel-UAE deal shows how the very notion of Middle East peace has shifted under Trump",
      "text": "Posted By: Editor Those ties don’t negate Palestinian demands, which Arab states have backed as a bloc, but represent a growing view of the decades-long conflict as a drag on the region’s economic opportunity and political clout. The UAE agreement grew out of commercial and other contacts between Israel and the wealthy Gulf nation that predate Trump’s presidency and are mostly rooted in regional concerns. “We saw an opportunity to take a bold step, one with the potential to fashion a new regional paradigm and introduce a new way of thinking — pragmatic, practical and solution-oriented,” said Omar Ghobash, the UAE assistant minister of public diplomacy. “The paradigm is also one of substantially greater collaboration across critical areas, including but not limited to technology, trade and education, and a strong reduction in the level of tensions. We believe Israel is keenly aware of that same potential.” Palestinian leaders were not informed of the plan and accused the UAE of selling them out. They reject the UAE assertion that the deal protects Palestinian interests by conditioning it on Israel’s agreement not to go forward with annexation of West Bank land. Trump and Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and the adviser he picked to lead Middle East peace efforts, said other agreements normalizing ties are expected soon. Oman and Bahrain, with similarly established unofficial relationships with Israel, are considered the most likely to do so. They could follow the UAE’s lead before the U.S. election, giving Trump further bragging rights. For Trump, the piecemeal approach makes a virtue of his inability to launch the face-to-face talks between Israel and the Palestinians he had hoped could come early in his presidency. Palestinians walked away from the Kushner effort at the end of Trump’s first year in office, when he announced that the United States would recognize Jerusalem as the Israeli capital and move the U.S. Embassy there. Arab states opposed the Jerusalem embassy move because of the Palestinian demand for a capital in East Jerusalem. But they continued to engage with Kushner, and in the case of the UAE, Oman and Bahrain, among others, continued to engage with Israel. A Gulf state official who asked not to be identified by name or nationality to speak freely said the deal recognizes that the Middle East is different than it was when Saudi Arabia put forward a bloc proposal for peace with Israel in 2002. “The realities in the Middle East have changed tremendously since the Arab Peace Initiative,” the Gulf State official said. “The threats against our nations have increased, we have gone through severe turmoil and people in the region understood that even if people call us their allies today, tomorrow they might forget about all of their promises and we are left alone.” The official listed Iran, Turkey and Qatar as aggressors and the political uncertainties in the United States as a factor many Gulf states are considering. Trump withdrew the United States from the international nuclear deal reached with Iran under former president Barack Obama, but a President Biden might reinstate it. Or, if Trump is reelected, he has said he would be open to a new deal with Iran that he predicted last week could be reached in “one month.” Israel was as eager as the United States to isolate the Palestinian question, but for its own reasons. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu trumpets his contacts with Gulf Arab neighbors, saying those states are ready markets for trade and tourism. Other Israeli officials acknowledge intelligence sharing going back years, mostly about Iran. “Many people believed that the road to peace with the Arab states must go through Ramallah,” said Ron Dermer, Israel’s ambassador to Washington, in an interview. “It does not. The road to peace with the Palestinians goes through Ramallah,” the seat of the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank, “but the road to peace with the Arab states goes through Cairo, Amman, Abu Dhabi and elsewhere.” Egypt was the first Arab state to make peace with Israel, in 1979. Jordan followed in 1994. Both agreements were under U.S. auspices. “This is a historic step forward, and things like this don’t happen every day,” Kushner told reporters Friday. “So we’re very, very proud of the accomplishment and of the step forward, and we hope that it really inspires a lot of people in the region to see the potential for what can be, if you’re willing to be creative and take a little bit of risk.” The Palestinians will have to decide for themselves how they respond, Kushner said later. “Kushner as usual misreads the whole situation,” said Hanan Ashrawi, a longtime Palestinian adviser. “I think if he wants, or if they want, to move on, then the better move is to comply with international law,” she said of the United States and Israel. “Withdraw from territories that were occupied and stolen from the Palestinians. This is how you move on.” Ashrawi dismissed the UAE description of the agreement as a way to salvage the potential for a more viable future Palestinian state. Annexation is shelved as a price of the agreement, but not off the table. Kenneth Katzman, a Congressional Research Service analyst focused on the Persian Gulf, called the deal “an evolution.” “We’ve seen over the last six or eight years a clear, growing set of ties between the two countries,” he said. “More and more visits, more and more discussion of security issues, Iran obviously being the focus of that.” Middle East analysts agreed with Trump that the accomplishment is genuine and historic, and probably could not have happened now without the U.S. imprimatur. But it also fits a pattern for Trump of claiming more credit than may be deserved. “The UAE-Israel strategic relationship was fueled by mutual fears of Iran, and formalized by the United States,” said Karim Sadjadpour, a Middle East analyst at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “It’s an example of Trump slapping his name on a hotel that was essentially already built.” Ashrawi called it a marriage of convenience on all sides but that of the Palestinians. Netanyahu can distract from legal problems and protests over his handling of the coronavirus pandemic, she said. “The same thing with Trump, who is trying very hard to distract attention,” from his own problems with the virus, she said. “To show he can be a peacemaker even with something so minor as the UAE-Israeli agreement.” Post navigation",

      "text": "Posted By: Editor\nPresident Donald Trump sought to reframe the fall election two days before the Democratic National Convention, arguing on Saturday that key economic and pandemic indicators were moving in his favor, while attempting to shift blame for US Postal Service funding problems to Democrats and refusing to acknowledge his administration’s efforts to undermine the agency three months before Election Day.\n© Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images US President Donald Trump answers questions during a press conference in the Brady Briefing Room of the White House in Washington, DC, on August 14, 2020. (Photo by Nicholas Kamm / AFP) (Photo by NICHOLAS KAMM/AFP via Getty Images)\nThe President’s finger-pointing and misinformation about the upheaval within the USPS was his latest attempt to rewrite history in real time into a version that better suits his reelection narrative.\nHe’s long done the same with the economy. Glossing over the fact that the US economy contracted at a 32.9% annual rate during the second quarter and tens of millions of Americans have lost their jobs as a result of the pandemic, Trump claimed Saturday that the US is witnessing “the fastest economic recovery in American history” because of the “foundation” set by his administration. He touted an all-time high in retail sales and gains in the stock market as evidence of a rebound that would sway voters to support him in November.\nView Trump and Biden head-to-head polling\n“If I win, which — I hope to win, how can you not when you see numbers like this both on the virus and on the economy?” Trump said during a Saturday news conference at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey. “I mean, we should win. We should all keep this incredible thing going. And I built it once and I’ll build it again.” Blaming Democrats\nAt a time when his administration is engulfed in controversy over its efforts to curtail USPS operations when the demand for mail-in ballots has grown exponentially due to the pandemic, Trump tried to blame the agency’s funding woes on Democrats. He said they are blocking negotiations on the next stimulus package due to an impasse over the Democrats’ proposed aid package for states that drained their coffers while fighting the pandemic.\nOn Friday, the postal service, which is mired in longstanding funding problems, warned nearly all 50 states and Washington, DC, that mail-in ballots may not be received by election offices in time to be counted.\nCNN and other news organizations reported Friday that the postal service has reduced operating hours in several states and was removing letter collection boxes off streets in some states, according to union officials.\nThe postal service announced Sunday that it will stop removing collection boxes until after late November, citing “recent customer concerns” over the decisions.\nThe announcement came the same day that White House chief of staff Mark Meadows told CNN’s Jake Tapper on “State of the Union” that USPS will not dismantle any mail-sorting machines between now and Election Day.\n“Sorting machines between now and Election Day will not be taken off line,” Meadows said.\nHouse Democrats, who have been fuming over the postal service’s issues in recent weeks, said Sunday that they’re ramping up their probe into the agency, with Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer calling on Postmaster General Louis DeJoy and Chairman of the Postal Service Board of Governors Robert Duncan to testify before lawmakers next week.\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders echoed Democrats’ frustrations with the USPS on Sunday, telling Tapper on “State of the Union” that he thinks Pelosi should bring back the House to pass a bill providing much-needed funding to USPS and that the Democratic Party should be using their oversight authority to review the actions of DeJoy.\nDemocrats call on top USPS officials to testify\nTrump admitted last week during a Fox News interview that he opposes at least part of the proposed emergency funding infusion for the post office, because he believes the uptick in mail-in ballots during the pandemic will favor Democrats. In the NPR/PBS/Marist poll released last week, 62% of Joe Biden’s supporters say they plan to cast their ballot by mail, while 72% of Trump supporters say they will vote in person.\nDuring the Fox interview, Trump said Democrats want $25 billion for the USPS as part of the stimulus negotiations with $3.5 billion directed toward mail-in voting. He then repeated his baseless claim that mail-in voting will lead to voter fraud, stating that the $3.5 billion will go toward “something that’ll turn out to be fraudulent.”\nAmid criticism, USPS says it will stop removing collection boxes for 90 days\nRevealing his own political calculations as they relate to post office funding, Trump went on to say in that Fox interview that if Democrats don’t get that funding “that means you can’t have universal mail-in voting.” (House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has said the bipartisan board of governors that runs the USPS — a board whose members are appointed by Trump — requested the proposal of $25 billion for USPS in the next stimulus bill).\nOn Saturday, Trump continued to sow doubts about the integrity of the November election, claiming without any evidence that “universal mail-in voting is going to be catastrophic” and would “make our country a laughingstock all over the world.”\nHe claimed to not know the details of the scaling back of postal services under DeJoy, a GOP donor and Trump fundraiser, calling DeJoy a “fantastic man” who “wants to make the post office great again.” On Friday, CNN reported that the USPS inspector general is reviewing controversial policy changes by DeJoy, including eliminating overtime for workers.\n“I don’t know what he’s doing. I can only tell you he’s a very smart man,” Trump said Saturday.\nDemocrats are considering bringing the House of Representatives back into session as early as next week to discuss the issues facing the USPS, according to CNN reporting late Saturday.\nFormer President Bill Clinton criticized the changes made by the postmaster general on Saturday.\n“We expect our elected officials to protect the right to vote and to ensure every vote is counted. This attack on the Postal Service —an institution as old as the Republic itself and depended upon, and trusted by, millions of Americans— is designed to ensure that neither is done,” Clinton tweeted. Trump claims progress on the pandemic\nTrump tried to strike an upbeat tone on Saturday as he gave an update on coronavirus case positivity rates and hospitalization rates. He cited improvements in the test turnaround times by commercial labs and said the administration has intensified its focus on shielding the most at-risk individuals in nursing homes and long-term care facilities, by rushing protective gear and rapid testing equipment to those sites.\nAs of Saturday, there were at least 5.3 million coronavirus cases in the US and more than 169,000 US deaths. The seven-day average of new cases was trending down in 22 states as of Saturday, but last week, the US was continuing to average more than 1,000 deaths per day .\nAs the Trump administration continues its push for students to return to school for in-person instruction, new guidance from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the Covid-19 rates in children are steadily increasing , creating new fears for parents. An analysis by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Children’s Hospital Association also found that there has been a 90% increase in Covid-19 cases among children over the four-week period from July 9 to August 6.\nTrump also said Saturday he did not agree with the assessment of CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield that America could be primed for “the worst fall, from a public health perspective, we’ve ever had,” if people don’t follow the CDC guidelines on basic safety measures like wearing masks and avoiding crowds.\n“You can’t compare it to 1917, that was incredible. That was the worst ever by far,” Trump said Saturday, referring to the flu pandemic that caused tens of millions of deaths worldwide in 1918 and 1919. “No, I don’t agree with that.”\n“I do believe that Americans, many are wearing masks, which is a good thing,” Trump added, with no hint of irony, after he held out so long on wearing a mask in public and many of his most loyal GOP governors have refused to impose mask mandates in their states. “When you look at the numbers, the way the numbers are coming out, I mean, it’s very impressive when you see what’s happening…. We’ve done it right. We closed it up.”\nHe then immediately pivoted to the economy, which he is counting on to save his reelection prospects: “Our economy is going to set records — if stupid people aren’t elected next year, we’re going to have one of the greatest years that we’ve ever had.” Video: USPS warns states it may not be able to deliver ballots in time (CNN) USPS warns states it may not be able to deliver ballots in time What to watch next",

      "text": "Posted By: Editor\nJoe Biden’s lead over Donald Trump among registered voters has significantly narrowed since June , according to a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS, even as the former vice president maintains an advantage over the President on several top issues and his choice of California Sen. Kamala Harris as a running mate earns largely positive reviews.\n© Getty Images\nAnd on the eve of the party conventions , a majority of voters (53%) are “extremely enthusiastic” about voting in this year’s election, a new high in CNN polling in presidential election cycles back to 2003. Load Error\nOverall, 50% of registered voters back the Biden-Harris ticket, while 46% say they support Trump and Pence, right at the poll’s margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points. Among the 72% of voters who say they are either extremely or very enthusiastic about voting this fall, Biden’s advantage over Trump widens to 53% to 46%. It is narrower, however, among those voters who live in the states that will have the most impact on the electoral college this fall.\nView Trump and Biden head-to-head polling\nAcross 15 battleground states, the survey finds Biden has the backing of 49% of registered voters, while Trump lands at 48%.\nThe pool of battleground states in this poll includes more that Trump carried in 2016 (10) than were won by Hillary Clinton (5), reflecting the reality that the President’s campaign is more on defense than offense across the states. Taken together, though, they represent a more Republican-leaning playing field than the nation as a whole.\nThe movement in the poll among voters nationwide since June is concentrated among men (they split about evenly in June, but now 56% back Trump, 40% Biden), those between the ages of 35 and 64 (they tilt toward Trump now, but were Biden-leaning in June) and independents (in June, Biden held a 52% to 41% lead, but now it’s a near even 46% Biden to 45% Trump divide).\nTrump has also solidified his partisans since June. While 8% of Republicans or Republican-leaning independents in June said they would back Biden, that figure now stands at just 4%. And the President has boosted his backing among conservatives from 76% to 85%.\nBut the survey suggests that Trump’s voters are a bit more likely to say that they could change their minds by November (12% say so) than are Biden’s backers (7%).\nMore voters say their choice of candidate is about Trump than say it is about Biden. Nearly 6 in 10 say they support the candidate they do because of their view of Trump (29% say their Biden vote is more to oppose Trump, 30% say they are casting a Trump vote in support of him), while only 32% say Biden is the deciding factor (19% are voting in favor of Biden, 13% casting a ballot to oppose him).\nOverall, 54% disapprove of the way Trump is handling his job as president and 42% approve. That’s an uptick since June, and about on par with Trump’s ratings from earlier this year. It still lands the President near the bottom of a list of historical approval ratings for presidents seeking reelection just ahead of their nominating conventions. Trump lands ahead of Jimmy Carter (33% approval) and George H.W. Bush (35%), but below Barack Obama (48%), George W. Bush (49%), Bill Clinton (53%) and Ronald Reagan (54%).\nTrump’s favorability rating remains underwater nationally (43% see him favorably, 55% unfavorably), a bit worse than Biden’s 46% favorable to 47% unfavorable even split. In the battleground states, though, voters’ views on the two candidates are almost even: 52% have an unfavorable opinion of Biden, 54% of Trump. Both candidates are viewed favorably by 45% in those states. Kamala Harris seen as a good pick\nHarris joins the ticket with a narrowly positive favorability rating (41% have a favorable view, 38% unfavorable), which is an improvement since May when 32% of Americans said they had a positive view of her and 33% a negative one.\nBiden’s selection of Harris is rated as excellent or pretty good by most (52%), and 57% say it reflects favorably on Biden’s ability to make important presidential decisions. Most say she is qualified to be president should that be necessary (57%). And a majority, 62%, say her selection does not have much effect on their vote. People of color, though, are more likely than White people to say her selection makes them more likely to back Biden (28% among people of color, 18% among whites).\nCompared with other recent Democratic running mates, Harris fares well. The 30% who call her selection excellent outpaces the share who said so in CNN polling on John Edwards in 2004, Biden in 2008, Joe Lieberman in 2000 or Tim Kaine in 2016. And the 57% who say she is qualified to serve as president if that becomes necessary is only topped by Biden (63%) and Al Gore in 1992 (64%). On the issues\nThe poll suggests that supporters of the two candidates are living in alternate universes when it comes to the issues that matter to their vote. Overall, the economy, coronavirus, health care, gun policy and race relations are rated as extremely important by at least 40% of voters. But there are large gaps between Biden and Trump voters on the importance of these issues. Seventy percent of Biden voters say the coronavirus is critically important vs. 24% of Trump voters. Among Trump backers, 57% rate the economy as extremely important, while 37% of Biden voters agree. Majorities of Biden supporters (57% in each case) call health care and race relations extremely important, while only about 1 in 5 Trump backers agree (20% on health care, 22% on race relations).\nBiden tops Trump as better able to handle most of the issues tested in the poll: Racial inequality in the US, the coronavirus outbreak, health care and foreign policy. Trump wins out on handling the economy. Voters are closely divided over which candidate would keep Americans safe from harm (50% say Biden would, 47% Trump). And more generally, Biden is more often seen as having “a clear plan for solving the country’s problems” (49% choose Biden to 43% Trump) and as better able to “manage the government effectively” (52% Biden to 44% Trump).\nAnd when it comes to these top issues, nearly all Trump and Biden supporters think their man is the right one for the job. Just 1% of Biden backers say they would trust Trump over Biden to handle racial inequality in the US, and only 2% would trust Trump to handle the coronavirus outbreak. On the flip side, 2% of Trump voters say they would prefer Biden on the economy, and only 4% choose him on the coronavirus outbreak.\nOverall, Biden holds the edge on a range of positive traits often seen as valuable in a run for the White House. Most say he cares about people like them (53% Biden, 42% Trump), shares their values (52% Biden to 43% Trump), and is honest and trustworthy (51% Biden to 40% Trump). More also say Biden will unite the country and not divide it (55% Biden to 35% Trump). But in this matchup between two septuagenarians, voters are split over which one has the stamina and sharpness to be president (48% say Trump, 46% Biden).\nThe CNN Poll was conducted by SSRS August 12 through 15 among a random national sample of 1,108 adults reached on landlines or cellphones by a live interviewer, including 987 registered voters. The survey also includes an oversample of residents of 15 battleground states for a total subsample of 636 adults and 569 registered voters from those states. That subset was weighted to its proper share of the overall adult population of the United States. Results for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.7 percentage points. It is 4.0 points among registered voters and 5.4 points for results for registered voters in the battleground states.

Royal Dutch Shells (RDS-A) (RDS-B) third quarter 2015 earnings, on a current cost of supplies (CCS) basis (see Note [2]), were a loss of $6.1 billion contrast with a gain of $5.3 billion for the same quarter a year ago. Third quarter 2015 CCS earnings comprised identified items of $7.9 billion. Third quarter 2015 CCS earnings not taking into account identified items (see page 5) were $1.8 billion contrast with $5.8 billion for the third quarter of 2014, a decrease of 70%. Earnings were influenced by non-cash charges of some $1.0 billion related to adverse currency exchange rate effects on deferred tax positions and financing items which were not comprised as identified items. Contrast with the third quarter 2014, CCS earnings not taking into account identified items comprised improved Downstream and lower Upstream results. In Downstream, earnings benefited from steps taken by Shell to improve financial performance and from higher realised refining margins. Upstream earnings were negatively influenced by lower oil and gas prices, partly offset by lower costs, raised production volumes and improved operational performance. Basic CCS earnings per share not taking into account identified items reduced by 70% as compared to the third quarter 2014. Cash flow from operating activities was $11.2 billion, contrast with $12.8 billion for the same quarter last year. Not Taking Into Account working capital movements, cash flow from operating activities was $5.3 billion, contrast with $11.1 Total dividends distributed to Royal Dutch Shell plc shareholders in the quarter were $3.0 billion, of which $0.7 billion were settled under the Scrip Dividend Programme. No shares were bought back during the third quarter. Gearing at the end of the third quarter 2015 was 12.7%. A third quarter 2015 dividend has been declared of $0.47 per ordinary share and $0.94 per American Depositary Share (ADS).\nRoyal Dutch Shell plc operates as an independent oil and gas company worldwide. It operates through Upstream and Downstream segments. The company explores for and extracts crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids. It also converts natural gas to liquids to provide fuels and other products; markets and trades natural gas; extracts bitumen from mined oil sands and converts it to synthetic crude oil; and generates electricity from wind energy.\nShares of Endo International plc (NASDAQ:ENDP), inclined 4.05% to $60.89,\nEndo Pharmaceuticals Inc., a partner of Endo International plc (ENDP) (ENL.TO), and BioDelivery Sciences International, Inc. (BDSI), declared that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved BELBUCA™ (buprenorphine) buccal film for use in patients with chronic pain severe enough to require daily, around-the-clock, long-term opioid treatment and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate. BELBUCA™, which is the first and only buprenorphine developed with a dissolving film that is absorbed through the inner lining of the cheek for chronic pain administration, is predictable to be commercially available in the U.S. during the first quarter of 2016 in seven dosage strengths, allowing for flexible dosing ranging from 75 micrograms to 900 micrograms every 12 hours. This enables physicians to individualize titration and treatment based on the optimally effective and tolerable dose for each patient.\nThe availability of new, convenient and flexible treatment options is important for patients whose lives are burdened by chronic pain, a debilitating condition that affects more Americans than diabetes, heart disease and cancer combined, said Richard L. Rauck , M.D., Director of Carolinas Pain Institute, Winston Salem, NC . BELBUCA™ provides a unique approach for chronic pain administration, combining the proven efficacy and established safety of buprenorphine with a novel buccal film delivery system that adds convenience and flexibility. For both opioid-naive and opioid-practiced patients who require around-the-clock treatment and for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate, BELBUCA™ offers appropriate, compriseent pain relief and a low incidence of typical opioid-like side effects.\nBELBUCA is a mu-opioid receptor partial agonist and a potent analgesic with a long duration of action that utilizes BDSIs patented BioErodible MucoAdhesive (BEMA®) drug delivery technology. Through this unique delivery system, buprenorphine is efficiently and conveniently delivered across the buccal mucosa (inside lining of the cheek). Buprenorphine is a Plan III controlled substance, meaning that it has been defined as having lower abuse potential than Plan II drugs, a category that comprises most opioid analgesics. Among chronic pain patients taking opioids, the vast majority are on daily doses of 160 mg of oral morphine sulfate equivalent (MSE) or less. With seven dosage strengths up to 160 mg MSE, BELBUCA™ offers a treatment choice for a wide range of opioid needs in chronic pain sufferers.\nEndo International plc, a specialty healthcare company, focuses on branded and generic pharmaceuticals and devices worldwide. It operates through four segments: U.S. Branded Pharmaceuticals, U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals, Devices, and International Pharmaceuticals.\nFinally, Shares of EQT Corporation (NYSE:EQT), 0.03% gain, and closed at $64.03.\nEQT Corporation, declared the election of Christine J. Toretti as the newest member to its Board of Directors, where she will serve as a member of the Corporate Governance Committee.\nMs. Toretti brings two decades of experience within the energy industry, as the former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the S. W. Jack Drilling Co., a large, family owned Appalachian Basin oil and gas drilling company that was sold in 2010. Ms. Toretti is a former director of the Pittsburgh Federal Reserve Bank; and since 1984, she has served as a member of the board of directors of S&T Bancorp, Inc., a publicly traded financial holding company, where she presently serves as Vice Chairman of the board and a member of the Nominating Committee.\nIn addition, Ms. Toretti is the Founder and Chair of both the Anne B. Anstine Excellence in Public Service Series in Pennsylvania, and the Dodie Londen Excellence in Public Service Series in Arizona.

This compares with net earnings of $133 million, or 26 cents per diluted share, for second quarter 2015 and net earnings from ongoing operations before special items of $178 million, or 33 cents per diluted share, for the same period last year. Third quarter 2014 net earnings of $1,153 million, or $2.15 per diluted share, comprised after-tax gains of $975 million from suspended operations and special items, primarily related to the divestiture of Weyerhaeuser Real Estate Company.\nNet sales totaled $1.8 billion, contrast with net sales of $1.8 billion for the second quarter, and $1.9\nI am very happy with our third quarter performance, as each of our businesses leveraged operational excellence improvements to drive strong results despite market and global macroeconomic headwinds, said Doyle R. Simons, president and chief executive officer. In addition, we delivered on our ongoing commitment to return cash to shareholders by increasing our quarterly dividend by 7 percent and have accomplished the $700 million share repurchase authorized in 2014. We remain relentlessly focused on driving value for our shareholders and fully capitalizing on an improving US housing market.\nWeyerhaeuser Co. is a real estate investment trust. It primarily invests in United States. The firm operates under four business segments, timberlands, wood products, cellulose fibers and real estate. It owns timberlands primarily in the U.S and has long-term licenses in Canada.\nShares of Tyson Foods, Inc.

In Europe, more than 14,000 people suffer from AML, and most of these patients will die within less than one year. As an acute leukaemia, AML progresses rapidly and is typically fatal within months if stem cell transplantation is not an option. In elderly patients ( >65 years), overall survival with AML has not improved in more than 40 years, and there is a clear need for treatments that can support this patient population.\nCelgene Corporation, a biopharmaceutical company, discovers, develops, and commercializes therapies to treat cancer and inflammatory diseases in the United States and Internationally. It markets REVLIMID, an oral immunomodulatory drug for multiple myeloma, myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), and mantle cell lymphoma; ABRAXANE, a solvent-free chemotherapy product to treat breast, non-small cell lung, pancreatic, and gastric cancers; POMALYST/IMNOVID to treat multiple myeloma; and VIDAZA, a pyrimidine nucleoside analog to treat intermediate-2 and high-risk MDS, and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, in addition to acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

      "text": "Home / Market Insight, Financial Articles / The Rise of Fintech The Rise of Fintech By Jeff Remsburg , Contributing Editor Aug 16, 2020, 9:20 pm EDT August 16, 2020\nChances are you’ve seen some recent headlines about “the death of cash,” accelerated by the coronavirus.\nDespite these predictions, a report by Cardtronics notes “preferred payment methods are virtually identical today to the fall of 2019.”\nBut as our macro specialist, Eric Fry, wrote in his Smart Money article this week, “old habits die hard. But that’s okay. New habits grow exponentially.”\nWhat is Eric talking about?\nThe rise of fintech — a market expected to nearly double to $10.1 trillion by 2024.\nIn today’s Digest , let’s turn to Eric to look at one current, huge fintech winner — and at another company that he believes will be a future huge winner …\nI’ll let Eric take it from here.\nHave a great weekend, Old Habits Die Hard, but New Habits Grow Exponentially\nBy Eric Fry\nThey’ve been predicting the death of cash for about as long as I can remember.\nAnd over the decades, as debit cards, online banking, and electronic payments arose, their arguments that cash would soon become obsolete became more feverish (but also more coherent).\nI’ve likely made a few such speculations myself over the years … but last time I checked, I still had a handful of change in my pocket.\nThen, as COVID-19 started messing with our lives, the usual suspects started once again talking up the “death of cash” anywhere that would have them.\nIndeed, it’s easy to see “dirty” cash as a possible coronavirus vector point.\nHowever, a recent report from Cardtronics compared consumer payment preferences from the depths of the coronavirus crisis in April 2020 to those in the pre-COVID-19 fall of 2019. In the fall of 2019, 16% of all consumers picked cash as their “most preferred payment method.” In April, 15% of consumers picked cash.\n“Preferred payment methods are virtually identical today to the fall of 2019,” the Cardtronics report noted.\nOld habits die hard.\nBut that’s okay. New habits grow exponentially.\nThe long-term trends for fintech are rising. Adapt Insights pegged the market at $4.8 trillion by at the end of 2019, and it says that figure will nearly double to $10.1 trillion by 2024.\nThat’s because companies that develop and employ cutting-edge technology are growing to huge sizes faster than ever … grabbing market share faster than ever … and changing the world faster than ever.\nThis exponential progress is creating a Technochasm between companies that develop and use technology successfully … and those that don’t.\nSo today let’s take a look at one current huge fintech winner — and at another company that I believe will be a future huge winner …\nBank on This\nBefore going further, let’s define fintech.\nThe term refers to any new technology that improves or automates financial transactions. But increasingly, fintech has become shorthand for any type of disruptive finance-focused technology, from mobile payment apps to cryptocurrencies.\nGenerally speaking, fintech companies enable individuals and companies to conduct financial transactions without having to use traditional bank-based channels.\nSquare Inc. (SQ) is one of them, and it is probably the best-known “disrupter” of payment processing. The San Francisco-based company focuses on small businesses — enabling them to take payments through a variety of point-of-sale mobile payment methods.\nMillions of merchants use Square’s app to process payments through their smartphones. You may have seen a taxi driver, for example, take a payment by swiping your credit card through a plug-in device on his smartphone. That taxi driver was probably using the Square app.\nSquare is a leading payment processor that is attempting to become a leading digital bank, also known as a “digital wallet.”\nFrom its inception, Square has provided payment processing services to small merchants — predominantly a mobile app that enables merchants to process credit card payments on their mobile devices.\nThis business has grown rapidly for many years but has been slowing recently.\nHowever, the company also operates fast-growing digital banking services via its Cash App. Because this business has been growing at triple-digit rates year-over-year, it now accounts for about one third of Square’s gross profits.\nAnd based on the growth trajectory of this business, it should account for half of gross profits within two years.\nCash App is a money transfer platform that allows users to send, store, and/or receive cash. But Square continues to add features the platform to make it more competitive in the marketplace.\nAnd there is plenty of competition!\nThat’s the biggest risk to the stock. Square competes against folks like Venmo, Zelle, and Apple Pay.\nAnother risk is that the company is prioritizing revenue growth and market share over profitability.\nEven so, it has been generating robust free cash flow. Assuming the company’s core payment-processing business maintains slow and steady growth, while the digital banking business generates high double-digit growth, Square will be a winner.\nBut it won’t be the only one …\nA Square Path\nThat’s why I think you should take a look at a company whose business model is very similar to Square’s, which is why many folks refer to it as the “Square” of the nation it calls home.\nSquare has soared nearly 1,500% since its 2015 initial public offering.\nI see this other stock — one of the top recommendations at Fry’s Investment Report — taking off on a similarly profitable path …\nIt serves millions of entrepreneurs and small merchants in its home country, so it is well positioned to prosper from renewed economic vitality in that nation.\nThe company describes itself as a fintech disrupter focused on small and even micro-sized companies. It enables small merchants to process digital transactions without having to use banking or credit card intermediaries.\nIn roughly three years, the company has more than tripled its count of active merchants. Earnings have also more than tripled during the last three years.\nBut fast-growing companies like this rarely deliver breakneck growth every single quarter. That’s not how the world works … usually.\nInstead, fast-growing companies achieve their growth in fits and starts. That’s what this company has done — and continues to do.\nEarlier this year, the stock had crumbled 70% from its high last September to less than $15. But since that low, the stock has more than doubled — making it one of the best stocks in one of the world’s hardest hit stock markets.\nYear-to-date, it’s now up 12.5%, even though its home nation’s stock market is down more than 30%. Despite the COVID-19 crisis, the company still managed to produce impressive year-over-year growth during the first quarter. A few pertinent highlights would include: 24% increase in active merchants on its payment platform 27% jump in revenue 13% gain in net income 10% boost in cash on the balance sheet\nAdditionally, the company seems to be benefiting from the coronavirus in at least two ways …\nFirst, its core customer base of micro-merchants is made up of the kind of entrepreneurs who cannot afford to shelter in place. They must work to eat, and so they are continuing to operate throughout the coronavirus crisis.\nSecond, it offers a “touchless payments” option for individuals who transact over its platform. Because of virus fears, touchless payments have become increasingly popular, relative to cash transactions.\nMeanwhile, the company continues to make rapid strides with its digital banking venture. From a standing start a little more than year ago, the venture has attracted 3.7 million people to its digital banking platform. And many of these new customers are eager to reduce their exposure to the coronavirus by using its many digital services.\nBottom line: This company is performing extremely well in the midst of challenging macroeconomic conditions.\nThe road ahead is not likely to get any easier until sometime next year. But as long as the company maintains its momentum and continues to gain market share, I’d expect the stock to reach a new high in 2021.\nNow, I can’t give you the name of this company. It wouldn’t be fair to the members of my Fry’s Investment Report service, where it’s shaping up to be one of our biggest winning trades.\nBut you can find out more about how to join us — and about the many other future huge winners in our portfolio — by heading here .\nRegards,",

(NYSEMKT:AVL) Trending Stock to Observe: Ball Corporation (NYSE:BLL), Ford Motor Co. (NYSE:F), Avalon Rare Metals Inc. (NYSEMKT:AVL) , Uncategorized Comments Off on Trending Stock to Observe: Ball Corporation (NYSE:BLL), Ford Motor Co. (NYSE:F), Avalon Rare Metals Inc. (NYSEMKT:AVL)\nDuring Tuesday’s trade, Shares of Ford Motor Co. (NYSE:F), gained 0.98% to $14.46.\nFord Motor Company recently is announcing a series of changes in its senior leadership team as it continues to deliver the company’s One Ford plan for profitable growth.\nJohn Fleming, executive vice president, Manufacturing and Labor Affairs, has elected to retire after more than 48 years at Ford. Throughout his career at Ford, Fleming, 64, has served in several leadership positions in the U.S. and Europe.\nHe most recently has led Ford’s Manufacturing and Labor Affairs operations, responsible for overseeing the global operations of 66 assembly, stamping and powertrain plants in addition to the UAW-Ford labor negotiations and contract ratification. Before being named to his current position in August 2010, he served dual roles as Chairman and CEO of Ford of Europe and executive vice president, Manufacturing and Labor Affairs.\n“John’s extensive global knowledge and strong leadership have played important roles in our European operations and product quality gains in our manufacturing throughout the world,” said Mark Fields, Ford president and CEO. “During his career, John also was instrumental in leading our team and negotiating labor agreements with our union partners that have enabled us to deliver strong business results and innovative new products for our customers.”\nFord Motor Company manufactures and distributes automobiles worldwide. The company operates through two sectors, Automotive and Financial Services. The Automotive sector develops, manufactures, distributes, and services vehicles, parts, and accessories.\nShares of Ball Corporation (NYSE:BLL), declined -0.55% to $69.04, during its current trading session.\nBall Corporation, declared recently that it has commenced an underwritten public offering of about €1.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of U.S. dollar-denominated Senior Notes due 2020 and euro-denominated Senior Notes due 2020 and 2023. The exact terms and timing of the offering will depend upon market conditions and other factors.\nBall intends to use the net proceeds from the offering, together with borrowings under its credit facilities and cash on hand, to fund the cash portion of the purchase price payable in connection with the consummation of Balls acquisition of Rexam PLC. Ball continues to work with regulators to obtain the regulatory clearances required to close the acquisition, and at the present time, the aggregate global divestitures under negotiation have estimated aggregate annual revenue in the range of $2.5 billion, using 2014 foreign currency translation rates and 2014 aluminum input prices. The negotiations with the regulators are ongoing and are not finalized, and there can be no assurance that Ball will reach satisfactory resolution with the regulators or that the amount of required divestitures will not change. In addition, Ball believes that after the consummation of the acquisition of Rexam PLC, it will be able to achieve net annual cost synergies in excess of $300 million in the third financial year of operations of the combined company.\nBall Corporation, together with its auxiliaries, supplies metal packaging products to the beverage, food, personal care, and household products industries worldwide. It operates in four segments: Metal Beverage Packaging, Americas and Asia; Metal Beverage Packaging, Europe; Metal Food and Household Products Packaging; and Aerospace and Technologies.\nFinally, Shares of Avalon Rare Metals Inc. (NYSEMKT:AVL), lost -3.11%, and is now trading at $0.0871.\nAvalon Rare Metals, is happy to provide an update on progress at its East Kemptville Tin-Indium Project, Nova Scotia, Canada, and declare the release of its fourth annual comprehensive Sustainability Report entitled Balancing Opportunities (the 2015 Sustainability Report) together with the release of its 2015 annual filings.\nUpdate on East Kemptville Tin-Indium Project\nThe Company is ongoing to work towards concluding a Preliminary Economic Analysis (PEA) on the East Kemptville Project. While the Company had originally targeted having a PEA accomplished by the end of November, that timeline has proven to be unrealistic. The Company now plans to have a PEA accomplished in early calendar 2016 which will allow for the 2015 drilling data to be compiled and integrated into an updated resource estimate. It will also allow more time for completion of ongoing metallurgical testwork and finalization of the transfer of surface tenure at the site to Avalon.\nThe 2015 drilling program was accomplished on November 19, 2015, at a total of 4,514 metres in twenty two holes. Initial results from this drill program were released on November 3, 2015. Assays are now pending for the remaining drill holes which tested the Duck Pond Zone and the Main Zone extension. The PEA will now incorporate all the new data generated from the 2015 work program counting the results of preliminary environmental assessment work.\nBefore finalizing the PEA, the Company plans to evaluate a number of alternative development scenarios for the scale of the operation. One interesting possibility to be considered is to initiate production at a relatively small scale by utilizing the existing ore stockpiles on the site, before eventually re-starting mining operations at a larger scale. This scenario has the attraction of potentially realizing production and cash flow in the relative short term with a small initial capital investment in a mill and gravity circuit to produce tin concentrate. A detailed cost-benefit analysis of this scenario is presently being undertaken by the Companys technical team.\nAvalon Rare Metals Inc. explores and develops rare metals and minerals primarily in Canada. The company focuses on exploring rare earth elements, and other rare metals and minerals, counting lithium, tantalum, niobium, cesium, indium, gallium, yttrium, and zirconium, in addition to tin. ",

If for any reason the acquisitions do not close, Teva anticipates to use the net proceeds from these offerings for general corporate purposes. Teva intends to grant the underwriters in each offering the option to purchase up to an additional 10% of the ADSs and up to an additional 10% of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Shares, in each case, solely to cover overallotments, if any.\nBarclays, BofA Merrill Lynch, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, BNP Paribas, Credit Suisse, HSBC, Mizuho Securities, RBC Capital Markets and SMBC Nikko are acting as the joint book-running managers for the offerings.\nShares of Amgen, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMGN), declined -1.48% to $161.10, during its last trading session.\nAmgen, declared the submission of a Biologics License Application (BLA) with the United States (U.S.) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for ABP 501, a biosimilar candidate to Humira® (adalimumab).

Phase 3 comparative efficacy and safety studies were conducted in both moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis and moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis. The Phase 3 studies met their primary endpoints showing clinical equivalence to adalimumab. Safety and immunogenicity of ABP 501 were also comparable to adalimumab. Data to support the transition of adalimumab patients to ABP 501 are comprised in the submission.\nFinally, Shares of Solar City Corp (NASDAQ:SCTY), ended its last trade with 3.72% loss, and closed at $28.76.\nSolar City (SCTY), Americas #1 solar power provider, is expanding its Nevada presence with a new, 13,000-square foot regional training center in West Las Vegas.

      "text": "8/17/2020 3:35:19 AM\nA week of politics\nIt's a reasonably quiet calendar next week as we move through the last legs of summer, but the flash PMIs on Friday will be in the spotlight and provide a glimpse of how the global economy has performed into August. Otherwise, next week sees the Fed and the ECB release minutes from recent meetings, and we also have a few remaining earnings releases. Finally, politics will get some attention when, besides the stimulus squabble, the Democratic convention starts up in the US.\nGiven the failure of Congress to reach an agreement on the lineation of the next fiscal package, the focus will be on high-frequency indicators of spending and employment. With the Democratic and Republican nominating conventions taking place over the next couple of weeks, a deal is unlikely to materialize until the end of the month. This presents a problem for the 28 million Americans who received an employment wage subsidy in July and who, on the face of it, if they had not found employment, had their monthly income shaved by over 60% in August. Last week, based on mobility tracking data, there was evidence that the expiration of Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation (FPUC), which provided those receiving jobless claims $600 in extra benefits per week, was beginning to weigh on consumer behavior.\nThis delay presents a bit of a dilemma for monetary policymakers where Chair Powell, in his latest testimony before Congress, was a blatant as can be about the need for further fiscal support to aid the recovery. Indeed, the minutes of the July 29 FOMC meeting, released on Wednesday afternoon, will likely be the main event for market participants, barring an unexpected breakthrough in the Congressional stalemate.\nThe US election risk will likely pick up\nIf Trump wins, we should see single-digit upside initially. In that scenario, we would assume the pre-election ~2% discount reverses as regulation/tax fear is unwound, but the upside is tempered by fear of renewed trade tension.\nAnd is a Dem sweep not as bad as feared? We could see equities down an additional 2% but bounce back as Biden wipes the slate clean with China and removes all tariffs, which will offset the fall in stocks .\nIt would be easy to assume that Biden’s 2 trillion green revolution would be a rubber stamp. Still, Biden wants to bite the hand that feeds as an energy overhaul will face immense opposition from fossil fuel lobbyists, but as we see right now, big oil is already lining up at the trough looking for ESG handout.\nBut in the face of an immense debt load, the last thing the US government needs it to lose tax revenue from gasoline. There will come a day when electric cars do to the oil industry what Edison's lightbulb did to the candle factory, but I don't think it’s imminent.\nHowever, the shift is on to ESG and with the big green lining up at the trough, that’s the first spot I think opportunities lie in a Biden White House.\nOn the opposite side of the coin, health insurance executives would be dancing for joy as there would be no chance of ACA. I need to put my money in O&G as not only is the sector utterly depressed, the Trump administration will loosen even more environmental protections that were put in place during the Obama administration.\nThe oil and gas industry is one of the direct beneficiaries of these EPA regulation rollbacks, and realizing the considerable tax revenue benefits from big oil, the Trump administration will do whatever it takes to help the industry recover from the most significant oil slump ever while appealing to his masses as there’s little debate that oil and gas companies have been among his biggest supporters.\nStephen Innes, AxiCorp Chief Global Market Strategist, contributed to this Reuters article on Friday, presenting his views on the upcoming US general elections: Wall Street Week Ahead: Biden victory? Disputed election? Wall Street prices in November outcomes\nEU-UK politics\nStaying with politics, another round of negotiations between the UK and the EU on their future relationship will take place from Tuesday to Friday next week. Recent remarks have struck a positive tone, with the UK's chief negotiator, David Frost, tweeting that \"Our assessment is that agreement can be reached in September and we will work to achieve this if we can.\" Meanwhile, the Irish Prime Minister also said that there was a \"landing zone\" for a deal.\nLosses in derivatives trading can exceed deposits.

As of late Ballard Power has seen its stock move out of its mid year lows and has been consistently moving move down because of a few noteworthy buy requests and late prominent field testing.\nBallard Power’s stock is a considerable measure like hydrogen itself: it can be unstable in the wrong hands however it can likewise be utilized for good. For all tech organizations required with the option fuel part there will dependably be a lot of hazard. The question gets to be which of the three option will be the one to end up as the winner. Electric vehicles still experience the ill effects of the charging issue yet can offer a non-carbon choice, however just if the nearby power matrix is not dependant on fossil fills, and there is the issue of securing lithium on a bigger scale.\nAs far as a speculation each of the three choices are still extremely unsafe and numerous have been scorched by unfulfillable guarantees and non-existent net earnings. Still there is some good faith with Ballard Power as its normal value target has moved to $2.70 contrasted with Tuesday’s end cost of $2.38 (C$3.14 on the TSX) and as of now has 3 in number purchase appraisals and 1 purchase rating.

      "text": "Home Stocks List Ascent Solar (NASDAQASTI) Ascent Solar (NASDAQASTI) Stocks List Comments Off on Ascent Solar (NASDAQASTI) Ascent Solar (NASDAQASTI)\nAscent Solar Have Massive Outstanding Shares\nAscent Solar (NASDAQ:ASTI) has for quite some time been an agitated organization with a background marked by stupendous weakening. From average deals development to negative gross edges (the organization’s 2015 cost of incomes was 44% higher than their aggregate incomes), plainly the organization’s plan of action is profoundly defective.\nHowever with Q3 reporting practically around the bend, I anticipate tending to the obvious issue at hand. This is the persevering and correctional weakening that Ascent Solar exacts upon its shareholders.\nIn the previous two years since the organization chose to move to creating buyer items, offers exceptional have expanded by around 2,000% while the stock cost has diminished 99.9%. This prohibits the massive weakening and share value decays that have occurred from that point forward.\nAfter the organization actualized a 20-1 invert split on June first 2016, the date of which is meant with a red bolt in the share value graph, the stock slammed more than 60%. What numerous didn’t notice was the ~44% expansion in shares extraordinary that occurred in the two months between Q1 reporting and the switch stock split, as shares remarkable unobtrusively developed from 11.8M to ~17M.\nFrom the reverse stock split on, June first through August fifth, the pace of weakening enormously quickened.\nIn the organization’s August fifth intermediary proclamation, which looks to enormously extend approved shares from 450M to 2B, the report noticed that there were 70.8M shares extraordinary as of August third.\nIn the wake of looking all the more carefully, I found that the organization has in reality developed shares remarkable by 316% in pretty much 10 weeks. It appears to me that a striking measure of this weakening (and coming about share value decay) may have come as an aftereffect of the company’s favored stockholders changing over to value and offering their shares away from any detectable hindrance advertise.

      "text": " Penny Stocks Articles Comments Off on Axcelis Technologies (NASDAQ:ACLS) Axcelis Technologies (NASDAQ:ACLS)\nAxcelis Technologies is an Innovative Company\nAnybody paying consideration on Axcelis Technologies (NASDAQ:ACLS) realizes that administration has turned the organization around from an item and money related point of view. The organization’s business prospects have been changed in the wake of creating and presenting the Purion stage of particle embed devices in the course of recent years.\nThe organization’s accounting report is boundlessly enhanced after a deal leaseback exchange executed in January 2015 that additional $49 million in real money to the monetary record. Taken a toll cutting and streamlining has brought down expenses and enhanced edges – the full advantage of which will start to be shown when ACLS conveys higher incomes.\nThe long haul focused situating of Axcelis has profited from the expanding innovation requests of 3D NAND and sub 20nm DRAM producing. Axcelis’ spot shaft innovation is especially appropriate for these applications and they remain to profit seriously from line transformations and new limit increments. Confirm that the organization’s Purion stage of particle implanters is appropriate to address the issues of expanding requests by DRAM and 3D NAND makers can be found in organization declared assessment and generation device shipments.\nSamsung has been a vast Purion client in the course of recent months and it was reported in January that a second Korean DRAM maker acknowledged an instrument that it was assessing. Generally known to be SK Hynix, Axcelis has a vast chance to supply Hynix’s M14 plant that is sloping as I compose this report.\nSemiconductor examiners have evaluated that the M14 plant could in the end deliver 100,000 wafer begins for every month (WSPM), which would require around 55 implanters. If ACLS somehow happened to win half of the 55 apparatuses required to run the DRAM plant, or approximately 27 Purion XE instruments, the income opportunity would be $135 million after some time, which is extremely huge to the organization.\nAxcelis is anticipating acknowledgment of an assessment device from the Intel Micron Flash Technologies (IMFT) joint wander in Lehi, UT. It is broadly trusted that the apparatus will be acknowledged in a matter of months, if not weeks. Acknowledgment of the apparatus and take after on generation orders for NAND and 3D Xpoint assembling would be tremendously positive as the volume of instruments would be generous and the positive effect to Axcelis’ notoriety would likely open numerous more entryways.

      "text": "Home Stocks List Array BioPharma Inc. (ARRY:NASDAQ) Array BioPharma Inc. (ARRY:NASDAQ) Stocks List Comments Off on Array BioPharma Inc. (ARRY:NASDAQ) Array BioPharma Inc. (ARRY:NASDAQ)\nArray BioPharma Inc. (ARRY:NASDAQ) has a market of $565M. This firm is working on late-stage clinical programs with modest expectations. Array’s binimetinib is currently being developed for ovarian cancer and melanomas, but combinations provide for a long-lived pipeline. An ex-US partnership is expected.\nArray BioPharma’s mix win in melanoma puts it financially behind, however maybe clinically in front of, Novartis (NYSE:NVS) and Roche (OTCQX:RHHBY). Movement free survival of 14.9 months for the binimetinib and encorafenib doublet is numerically superior to that of advertised contenders from the two Swiss gatherings, yet the littler biotech will come late to a business sector that looks restricted.\nBlends of Mek and Braf inhibitors have experienced issues extending from skin growth into different signs, and even in melanoma, their utilization is limited to those patients with a BRAF transformation. Still, this is conjecture to be a $2b market in 2022, and Array offers rose 55% in desire that the Colorado-based gathering will get an offer of it.\nThe three-arm Columbus study looked at the Array mix versus two single operators, Roche’s Braf inhibitor Zelboraf and Array’s encorafenib alone. The 14.9 month PFS survival over the 7.3 months recorded by Zelboraf patients was factually critical, despite the fact that the doublet neglected to demonstrate a measurably huge advantage over encorafenib monotherapy.\nIn latest earnings call, Array administrators did not reveal much insight into that confounding last result, other than to say that the “extent of impact” information would be critical for controllers to consider – the distinction between the mix and encorafenib arms simply missed measurable essentialness at a p estimation of 0.051.\nA significant part of whatever remains of the information will be kept down for presentation at a restorative meeting, with CEO Ron Squarer saying the gathering was focusing on the Society for Melanoma Research meeting in Boston toward the beginning of November. These information will incorporate subtle elements on unfriendly occasions, where a more middle of the road mix could demonstrate to have favorable position over the Novartis and Roche pairings, which convey with them skin, liver, cardiovascular and pneumonic toxicities.
